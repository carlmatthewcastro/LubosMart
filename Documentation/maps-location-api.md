# Maps, Address, and Location API Policy

## Purpose

This document defines the approved provider, privacy, fallback, and cost boundaries for LuboSmart features involving addresses, geocoding, coordinates, maps, pins, and road-distance ranking.

## Approved responsibilities

| Concern | Provider or component | Allowed use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Philippine administrative hierarchy | Bundled PSA PSGC data in `resources/js/psgc-address-data/data` | Search, validate, and canonicalize Region, Province, City/Municipality, and Barangay. |
| Forward geocoding | Geoapify Geocoding API | Resolve a completed, user-confirmed Philippine address after an intentional action. |
| Interactive map and pin | Geoapify map tiles rendered with Leaflet | Display confirmed coordinates and let the user click or drag a local HTML pin. |
| Road-distance ranking | Geoapify Route Matrix API | Compare one Seller pickup coordinate with a bounded set of eligible Logistics hub coordinates server-side. |
| Courier pickup route line | Geoapify Routing API | Build bounded road-following geometry through the server-authoritative hub → pickups → hub stop order. |
| Current-device coordinates | Browser or mobile operating-system geolocation | Populate coordinates after explicit permission. |
| Persistence and validation | Laravel API and Postgres | Validate and save authoritative address fields and optional coordinates. |

PSGC names and manually reviewed address fields remain authoritative. Coordinates assist routing; they do not replace the readable address or prove deliverability. Mapbox is not used.

## Address pinning flow

The Buyer, Seller, and Logistics sole-hub flow is:

```text
Select cascading PSGC address
  -> complete street and postal fields
  -> intentionally choose Pin location
  -> one Geoapify forward-geocoding request
  -> render a Geoapify map with Leaflet only after a result exists
  -> confirm or adjust the local pin
  -> Laravel validates and persists the address and coordinates
```

There is no provider request while the user types. Changing a populated textual location field clears the coordinate pair; the user must pin again. Manual saving remains available when Geoapify is unavailable.

## Route Matrix ranking

- Logistics hub coordinates are operator-confirmed routing inputs, not GPS-certified evidence. Save a complete validated pair on the hub's linked Address; unknown remains null.
- Registration may fall back to text-only with an unpinned message; existing authorized Admin dispatch accounts add/correct their pin through the protected Account Settings endpoint. No extra hub/address or access gate is created.
- Same-premises corrections preserve committed waybill/Order/manifest snapshots and invalidate future coordinate-fingerprint caches. Relocation and active-route replanning require their owning workflow.
- Reuse origin-restricted browser credentials for intentional geocoding/tiles; never expose the server Route Matrix/Routing credential. Provide attribution and accessible coordinate adjustment when drag interaction is unavailable.

- Call `POST https://api.geoapify.com/v1/routematrix` only from Laravel, using `GEOAPIFY_SERVER_API_KEY`; never expose this server credential to a browser bundle.
- Send one source and only bounded eligible hub targets. Each location uses GeoJSON order `[longitude, latitude]`; no names, phone numbers, street lines, Order contents, user IDs, or account IDs are sent.
- Use `mode=drive`. `sources_to_targets[0][n].distance` is authoritative metres and is converted to kilometres for display and persistence.
- Cache successful results by source and destination coordinate fingerprints. A changed pin produces a new fingerprint and cannot reuse the stale rank.
- Enforce a short timeout. An unconfigured key, absent coordinates, quota response, timeout, malformed response, or null route returns an unavailable distance and must not fabricate `0 km` or block manual selection of an otherwise eligible provider.
- Exact PSGC city/province/country matching is evaluated locally before road distance. Distance breaks ties and ranks eligible non-exact options only when authoritative values are available.
- Keep Geoapify and OpenStreetMap attribution visible wherever calculated distance is presented.

## Courier final-mile route geometry

Final-mile dispatch route geometry uses the same server-only Geoapify key and a bounded Matrix calculation for the assigned schedule's hub and destination stops. The ordered stops are sent to the Routing API for a road-following `LineString`; a private Geoapify `osm-bright` raster tile style is displayed through MapLibre GL JS in the development Courier mockup. The mockup draws a labelled Logistics start marker, numbered delivery circles for known coordinates, and a cased line above the tiles when at least two coordinates are known. Missing coordinates or provider failures yield an explicit unavailable route while the address list and delivery actions stay available; known locations remain visible and a Routing or Matrix failure keeps a labelled straight stop-sequence line. No point is fabricated for an unpinned address. Only destination-hub final-mile schedule members participate; linehaul routes remain independent.

## Courier pickup route geometry

- Determine the Courier stop order with the Route Matrix API first, then call `GET https://api.geoapify.com/v1/routing` from Laravel with the ordered hub → pickup stops → hub waypoints and `mode=drive`.
- Split routes at the configured provider waypoint limit with one overlapping waypoint so the returned road geometry can be combined without changing stop order.
- Send coordinates only—never addresses, names, phone numbers, parcel contents, or account identifiers—and keep `GEOAPIFY_SERVER_API_KEY` server-side.
- Persist the sanitized road `LineString` with the manifest. If routing fails or its quota guard is reached, keep the manifest ready and return a labelled straight stop-sequence fallback instead of blocking pickup work.

## Coordinate and privacy rules

- Latitude and longitude are optional unless a feature explicitly requires them, but they must be submitted as a complete pair and remain within `-90..90` and `-180..180`.
- Provider failures must not erase entered text or silently rewrite address fields.
- Do not put credentials, full addresses, or route payloads in logs.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY` (Buyer webapp) and `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY` (Seller dashboard) are origin-restricted browser keys for intentional forward geocoding and tiles. `GEOAPIFY_SERVER_API_KEY` is a separate server-only key for Route Matrix, Routing, and proxied Courier map-tile requests.

## Cost boundary

Geoapify usage shares the configured account allowance. A 1×N matrix consumes N baseline matrix cells/credits under the current pricing model. Treat free capacity as a launch allowance, meter requests and failures, and recheck pricing and terms before release or capacity changes.
