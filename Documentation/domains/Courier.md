# Courier Model Context

## Final-mile revision (2026-09-20)

The Courier accepts a destination-hub dispatch schedule as one bulk final-mile offer; its 1–15 parcel tasks still retain separate custody and delivery history. At drop-off, the Courier uploads a private photo POD, then explicitly sends **Delivered** intent to Logistics. Logistics confirms the photo before any Order/Shipment/task becomes `delivered`. A failed attempt records reason and time, leaves `out_for_delivery`, and permits a later retry. The accepted schedule can return advisory Geoapify Matrix/Routing stops and a road `LineString`; the development-only Courier mockup draws it with MapLibre. Linehaul transfers are a separate Logistics workflow. Historical reference-based delivery proof and route-deferred wording below is superseded for final-mile work.

As of 2026-09-21, the accepted final-mile task itself identifies the parcel for hub handoff; the Courier enters no parcel identifier. Logistics still validates hub pickup. The Courier sees the parcel's merchandise price and currency in the task, and the mockup uses `osm-bright` with a visible Logistics start, numbered delivery stops, and route line. Photo POD remains the only Courier-entered delivery proof.

## Overview

Courier (rider) is LuboSmart's delivery operator. Courier operations are exposed through Laravel API endpoints and consumed by an external React Courier application. This repository must not build a Courier web dashboard or other Courier UI under `resources/js/`.

The Courier works under one selected LuboSmart dispatch operation. The organization operates exactly one hub/sorting center in the MVP, and the Courier's hub affiliation is derived by the server. Courier access is therefore both account-scoped and Logistics-relationship-scoped.

## Registration, affiliation, and access boundary

- Registration collects the required personal fields, Philippine address, vehicle type, plate number, OR/CR, and ID/driver's-license evidence from `Documentation/references/user-registration-requirements.md`.
- MVP: exactly one vehicle per Courier, with required type/plate and private OR/CR for associated Logistics review. Multiple/shared vehicles, maintenance, vehicle history, and capacity values/units/matching are deferred. The vehicle registry API now supports post-approval detail edits and independent OR/CR replacement; registration/operational audit history remains intact.
- Age is calculated from `birth_date` by the API; a client-supplied age is never authoritative.
- Address selectors use the bundled PSGC Region → Province → City/Municipality → Barangay flow with manual street/house details and a complete manual fallback. If an exact pin is required, reuse the Buyer Address Book flow: optional Geoapify suggestions/coordinates after **Pin location** and a Leaflet map rendered with Geoapify tiles. Mapbox is not used.
- The applicant selects an eligible active LuboSmart dispatch operation. The API derives that organization's sole hub; the client cannot submit or select a hub/sub-hub ID.
- The selected LuboSmart dispatch operation is the sole Courier affiliation reviewer and approver for the MVP. Admin account suspension, restoration, and deactivation remain separate lifecycle actions; Admin does not approve a pending Courier affiliation.
- A pending, rejected, or revoked affiliation cannot issue a token or access Courier operations. Protected access also requires an active Courier account, an active LuboSmart dispatch operation, and a valid current hub.

The implemented authentication foundation includes the `courier` role, `CourierProfile`, one initial `Vehicle`, `CourierLogisticsAffiliation`, registration applications, private registration documents, addresses, Sanctum bearer-token login/logout, current-Courier identity, password-recovery entry point, and Logistics approval endpoints. Courier operational shipment and delivery data remain deferred until their shared contract exists.

## Courier lifecycle and status contract

Persisted and API status values use lowercase `snake_case`. PHP enum case names may use `PascalCase`, and UI labels are human-readable. Legacy/source terms such as `ACCEPTED`, `IN_TRANSIT`, `COMPLETED`, or `DELIVERED` are not canonical persisted values.

### Registration and affiliation lifecycle

```text
select active LuboSmart dispatch operation
→ submit pending Courier account and affiliation
→ Logistics review
   ↘ rejected/revoked → no Courier access
   ↘ approved + active → mobile sign in
active → suspended/deactivated or affiliation revoked → API access denied
```

Account status (`users.status`) and affiliation status (`courier_logistics_affiliations.status`) are separate facts. A Courier is operational only when both are valid.

### Delivery task lifecycle

The existing high-level `OrderStatus` remains the Buyer-facing order contract:

```text
pending_payment
→ placed
→ seller_processing
→ ready_for_pickup
→ picked_up
→ in_transit
→ out_for_delivery
→ delivered
```

Task-level `rejected` records an offered Courier's refusal and is not an `OrderStatus`; Admin dispatch operations may re-offer the same task to another eligible Courier without changing the Order. `stale` is an informational freshness condition for unfinished work, not a new high-level Order status, and it does not automatically cancel or reassign a task.

Courier actions must use the detailed Shipment/Delivery Task contract rather than treating a generic order status as proof of a physical handoff:

```text
awaiting_seller_pickup
→ seller_pickup_assigned
→ seller_pickup_accepted
→ picked_up_from_seller
→ received_at_hub
→ sorted_at_hub
→ dispatched_from_hub
→ delivery_assigned
→ delivery_accepted
→ picked_up_from_hub
→ in_transit
→ out_for_delivery
→ delivered
```

Courier-performed task actions and transitions are:

- **First mile:** `seller_pickup_assigned` → `seller_pickup_accepted` → `picked_up_from_seller`.
- **Final mile:** `delivery_assigned` → `delivery_accepted` → `picked_up_from_hub` → `in_transit` → `out_for_delivery` → `delivered`.

`received_at_hub`, `sorted_at_hub`, and `dispatched_from_hub` are Logistics-side milestones. Courier physical actions are submitted for Logistics validation; the shared transition service commits the state after the authoritative event is recorded. First-mile and final-mile assignments are independent: accepting or completing a first-mile pickup does not require or automatically grant the same Courier the final-mile assignment. Admin dispatch operations may assign the same or a different eligible Courier for final-mile delivery; the second task must be separately offered, accepted, and authorized. Each leg requires its own task, assignment, actor, timestamp, location, and scan/event history. Internal `in_transfer` execution remains deferred in the MVP.

Current COD placement skips `pending_payment` and starts the Order at `placed` with `payment_status = pending`; this payment detail is read-only to Couriers. The Seller-selected LuboSmart dispatch operation owns both task legs, and a Courier may operate only assigned/offered tasks within that organization.

For the high-level projection, explicit first-mile confirmation advances `ready_for_pickup → picked_up`; later Logistics dispatch scheduling advances `picked_up → assigned` after creating the final-mile offer. Pickup scheduling does not write that final-mile projection.

## Physical delivery flow

```text
Seller prepares the Order and confirms `ready_for_pickup`
→ selected LuboSmart dispatch operation creates and offers a first-mile Seller pickup task
→ first-mile Courier receives and accepts the task
→ Courier uses the shared waybill QR/tracking ID/reference to verify the parcel
→ Courier verifies and scans the parcel at the Seller
→ Courier confirms `picked_up_from_seller`
→ Courier transfers the parcel to the LuboSmart dispatch operation's sole hub
→ Admin dispatch operations receive the parcel (`received_at_hub`) using the same shared waybill/tracking ID
→ Admin dispatch operations sort, transfers, and dispatches it
→ Admin dispatch operations schedule the sorted parcel with a final-mile Courier (`delivery_assigned`)
→ final-mile Courier accepts (`delivery_accepted`)
→ Courier verifies and scans the parcel at the hub
→ Courier confirms `picked_up_from_hub`
→ Courier travels and delivers (`in_transit` → `out_for_delivery`)
→ Courier submits the required proof and completes delivery (`delivered`)
```

If a Courier rejects an offered first-mile or final-mile task, the task records `rejected`, the Order remains unchanged, and Admin dispatch operations may offer the same task to another eligible Courier. An unfinished task may become informationally `stale`; it is not automatically cancelled or reassigned. The Courier does not assign itself, change Logistics hub state, or complete a task belonging to another Courier. Courier-submitted scans and handoff evidence are validated and recorded authoritatively by Logistics, preserving the Courier who performed the action, the authorized Admin dispatch account that recorded it, and the event timestamp. Scans, access events, and manual actions are append-only history; a scan alone never advances custody.

## Courier capabilities and boundaries

### 1. Dashboard

- **Purpose:** Show delivery notifications, available first-mile pickup requests, available final-mile delivery requests, and the Courier's active jobs.
- **Owns:** Mobile read/aggregation, the dedicated notification inbox client, freshness indicators, task-detail navigation, and retry/empty/offline states. The Laravel notification API is implemented; the external React client remains separate from this repository.
- **Does not own:** Assignment authority, parcel state transitions, or a second source of truth for task data. Each row is scoped to the authenticated Courier and its approved Logistics relationship.
- **Data shown:** The operational Order, parcel, waybill, pickup, destination, item, and delivery-instruction fields required for the offered or accepted task, plus server-provided provider-neutral `distance_km` and `estimated_duration_minutes` when available. Secrets, private evidence, raw storage paths, and unrelated personal data are excluded.

### 2. Accept Delivery Requests

- **Purpose:** Let the Courier review task type, pickup and destination details, route/distance context, and package requirements before accepting an eligible task.
- **Owns:** Server-side revalidation at commit time, assignment to the authenticated Courier, and the `seller_pickup_accepted` or `delivery_accepted` transition.
- **Rules:** A client cannot choose another `courier_id`, accept an unavailable task, or accept a task outside its LuboSmart dispatch operation/hub. The Courier only accepts an offer created by Logistics; acceptance does not create a task or grant assignment authority. A Courier may reject an offered task; rejection records task-level `rejected`, leaves the Order unchanged, and allows Logistics to re-offer the same task to another eligible Courier. Concurrent or retried accepts/rejections are idempotent and cannot double-assign or overwrite task history. An unfinished task may be informationally `stale` and is not automatically cancelled or reassigned in the MVP.

### 3. Pick Up Order

- **Purpose:** Record physical possession after the Courier reaches the correct origin: the Seller for first mile or the Logistics hub for final mile.
- **Owns:** Parcel/waybill verification, camera or barcode scanning, handoff evidence capture, and submission of the physical event for Logistics validation. The explicit `picked_up_from_seller` or `picked_up_from_hub` transition is committed by the shared transition service after Logistics records the authoritative event.
- **Rules:** A generic `picked_up` OrderStatus is not proof of either physical handoff. Pickup cannot be confirmed for an unaccepted task, an incorrect parcel, or an unauthorized origin. The submitted event preserves the performing Courier, recording authorized Admin dispatch account, timestamp, and safe QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference or evidence metadata; the scan/access event alone never advances custody.

### 4. Deliver Order

- **Purpose:** Support final-mile transit to the Buyer with destination details and navigation context.
- **Owns:** The active delivery view, provider-neutral route context, and optional current-location updates while the task is assigned to the Courier.
- **Rules:** A separately approved, provider-neutral mapping service may supply `distance_km` and `estimated_duration_minutes` or route suggestions, but LuboSmart remains authoritative for task eligibility, organization/hub scope, and state. Distance/ETA is advisory and does not grant assignment or status authority. The Buyer checkout destination snapshot is the delivery destination; the Courier cannot edit it. Location collection is minimized and access-controlled. Mapbox is not a required provider.

### 5. Complete Delivery

- **Purpose:** Finalize a successful Buyer handoff after delivery requirements are satisfied.
- **Owns:** Completion eligibility checks, the final `delivered` task transition, the corresponding high-level Order projection, immutable completion history, and post-commit notification events.
- **Rules:** Completion is transactional and idempotent. It cannot bypass required proof, finalize another Courier's task, or be rolled back because a notification provider failed.

### 6. Proof of Delivery (e-POD)

- **Purpose:** Capture basic evidence that the parcel was handed over or placed at the approved destination.
- **Owns:** Mobile capture of the approved evidence type, validation, secure storage, and linkage to the authorized Delivery Task/Order.
- **Rules:** Image evidence follows `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`: JPEG/JPG, PNG, or WebP, strictly under 10 MiB, with signature/MIME/decode validation. Courier-submitted QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference scans and handoff evidence are validated and recorded authoritatively by Logistics, with performing-Courier and recording-Logistics actors preserved. Evidence is private, delivered only through authorization, and never returned as a raw storage path. QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference scan plus Courier identity and timestamp are the minimum physical-handoff evidence; photo/signature proof remains subject to the approved operational schema and shared upload policy.

### 7. Incident Reporting

- **Purpose:** Report breakdowns, accidents, inaccessible addresses, damaged parcels, or other delivery blockers to Logistics.
- **Owns:** A task-scoped incident record, safe description/evidence, severity, and notification handoff to the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation.
- **Rules:** Creating an incident does not silently mutate the Order or invent a new route. Logistics or an approved transition policy decides reassignment, pause, return, or recovery.

### 8. Chat/Messaging

- **Purpose:** Communicate with the relevant Buyer, Seller, or Logistics operator for an active task.
- **Owns:** Authorized task-linked threads, message delivery/read state, and operational access expiry.
- **Rules:** Conversations are temporary and participant-scoped. Phone numbers, private registration evidence, payment secrets, and unrelated users are not exposed.

### 9. Account Management

- **Purpose:** Maintain the authenticated Courier's personal profile, security credentials, and current vehicle information.
- **Owns:** Allow-listed self-service changes, password/session controls, and vehicle detail updates when permitted.
- **Rules:** Every mutation uses the authenticated `user_id`; email alone, another role's record, arbitrary profile IDs, or a client-selected affiliation cannot authorize an update. Approved vehicle endpoints permit editing type/plate/make/model and independent OR/CR replacement without reapproval, with associated Logistics notified after commit. License and payout changes retain their separate policy boundaries.

### 10. Delivery History

- **Purpose:** Provide a read-only archive of the authenticated Courier's completed delivery tasks.
- **Owns:** Bounded pagination, filters, detail navigation, and historical task summaries.
- **Rules:** History is Courier-scoped and uses the canonical `delivered` state or the approved completion state of the task contract. It does not expose another Courier's routes, Buyer private data, or raw evidence paths.

### 11. Profit Dashboard

- **Purpose:** Show earnings derived from the Courier's completed delivery work.
- **Owns:** Read-only period totals and bounded delivery-linked summaries once an authoritative earnings ledger exists.
- **Rules:** It must not infer payable earnings from Order totals or expose another Courier's financial data. The earnings ledger and payout policy are deferred.

### 12. Performance Metrics

- **Purpose:** Summarize personal completion rate, ratings, timing, and other approved quality measures.
- **Owns:** Derived, read-only metrics from authoritative completed tasks and eligible reviews.
- **Rules:** Metrics never rewrite task history or automatically impose incentives, suspension, or penalties without a separately approved policy.

### 13. Offline Mode

- **Purpose:** Keep essential task details and queued scans usable in temporary mobile dead zones.
- **Owns:** The external React app's bounded encrypted local cache and retry queue.
- **Rules:** Offline events carry idempotency keys and are revalidated on replay. The server remains authoritative; stale, conflicting, or unauthorized events are rejected or reconciled explicitly. No Courier web/offline UI belongs in this repository.

### 14. Digital Tipping and Feedback

- **Purpose:** Display Buyer tips or Courier feedback when those platform contracts exist.
- **Owns:** Read-only presentation of authorized tip/review records.
- **Rules:** Payment settlement, tip eligibility, and review moderation are separate features. Courier access cannot edit a Buyer review or manufacture a tip.

### 15. SOS/Emergency Button

- **Purpose:** Send a high-priority safety alert to the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation during an incident.
- **Owns:** Authenticated alert creation, active task context, severity, and the least location information needed for response.
- **Rules:** Last-known coordinates are protected and retained only under an approved policy. The feature does not promise direct local-authority integration or expose a Courier's unrestricted location history.

### 16. Earnings and Goal Tracker

- **Purpose:** Let a Courier view progress toward optional personal earning goals.
- **Owns:** Goal preferences and read-only progress presentation after the earnings contract exists.
- **Rules:** Goals do not alter assignment, payout, Order status, or Logistics capacity. This remains separate from authoritative earnings settlement.

## Operational invariants

- Every protected endpoint rechecks Sanctum authentication, `courier` role, active account status, approved affiliation, active LuboSmart dispatch operation, and valid sole hub.
- Every task, assignment, parcel, waybill, scan, incident, conversation, cache entry, and event is resolved server-side to the authenticated Courier and its authorized LuboSmart dispatch operation/hub.
- `delivery_assigned` is not `delivery_accepted`; neither means `picked_up_from_hub`. First-mile and final-mile pickup states remain distinct.
- First-mile and final-mile assignments are independent. Completing first-mile pickup does not require or automatically grant final-mile assignment; Admin dispatch operations may assign the same or a different eligible Courier for the second leg.
- A Courier may reject an offered task. The task records `rejected`, the Order remains unchanged, and Admin dispatch operations may re-offer the same task to another eligible Courier. An unfinished task may be informationally `stale`; it is not automatically cancelled or reassigned.
- One shared waybill/tracking ID is created and frozen in the Seller pickup transaction at `ready_for_pickup`; Seller and selected dispatch operation have role-scoped access, while an assigned Courier may resolve its opaque QR or submit the authorized tracking ID/reference. Route/assignment/scan changes are append-only events.
- Courier-submitted QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference scans and handoff evidence are validated and recorded by the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation. Physical event history preserves the performing Courier, recording authorized Admin dispatch account, timestamp, location/context, and safe evidence/reference metadata; a scan or waybill access event alone never advances custody.
- Courier operational writes are blocked until the reconciled shared Shipment/Delivery Task schema and transition contract are approved and migrated.
- State transitions are validated against the current task state, transactional, idempotent, and append immutable history. Notification, mapping, upload, or synchronization failure must not undo a committed decision.
- A Courier can read only its own operational data and the minimum authorized Buyer/Seller/Logistics details needed for the active task. Payment credentials, private registration/POD evidence, raw storage paths, and unrestricted location history are excluded from normal DTOs.

## Current and deferred data boundary

Implemented foundation:

- `users` Courier role and `CourierProfile` with server-derived age.
- One initial `Vehicle` per registration, with string-backed `VehicleType` and `VehicleStatus` casts. An additive migration enforces one vehicle per Courier after a duplicate preflight; service operations still fail closed if cardinality is ambiguous. See `Documentation/schema.md`.
- One current `CourierLogisticsAffiliation` linking the Courier to the selected organization and derived sole hub, with Logistics reviewer, decision, reason, and timestamp.
- Registration applications, private evidence documents, addresses, Sanctum tokens, Courier auth endpoints, and Logistics approval endpoints.

Deferred or dependent Courier operations:

- Photo/signature proof media, incidents, Courier availability/capacity, earnings, tips, metrics, route/location telemetry, and offline synchronization remain deferred. Seller pickup requests, shared waybills, pickup schedules, first-mile assignment/acceptance, explicit first-mile QR/tracking-ID/manual verification and pickup confirmation, Inventory fulfillment, and schedule route manifests are implemented. The additive shared Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask records now provide Logistics-authoritative hub/final-mile QR/tracking-ID evidence, task rejection/re-offer, final-mile assignment/acceptance, movement, completion intent, and delivery history; advanced recovery remains deferred.

Status-like database columns are stored as strings and cast to PHP enums. Operational records preserve the one-Logistics-organization/one-hub boundary and never place detailed physical milestones directly in `orders.status`.

## Shared contracts

- `Documentation/requirements.md` — Courier responsibilities and registration boundary.
- `Documentation/workspace.md` — external mobile boundary, approval flow, physical delivery flow, and canonical status vocabulary.
- `Documentation/schema.md` — implemented Courier foundation, deployed P0 operational entities, and deferred extensions.
- `Documentation/references/user-registration-requirements.md` — Courier registration fields and approval note.
- `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md` — evidence and proof upload policy.
- `Documentation/features/courier/*/specs.md` — feature-specific implementation contracts.

**Current/future boundary:** `ConfirmFirstMilePickup` remains the compatibility writer for the accepted Courier's Seller handoff and Inventory fulfillment, then idempotently bridges shared physical records without replaying stock. Hub and final-mile transitions use the Logistics-authoritative `FulfillmentTransitionService`; photo/signature proof media, route/location telemetry, and exceptional recovery remain future extensions.
