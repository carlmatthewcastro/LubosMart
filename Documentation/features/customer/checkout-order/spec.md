# Buyer Checkout & Order Creation

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Turn an authenticated Buyer's eligible Buy Now selection or selected Cart lines into one or more Shop Orders.
- **Current implementation:** Quote, COD placement, one-Order-per-Shop grouping, immutable snapshots, voucher redemption, inventory reservation, UUID idempotency, and private batch retrieval are implemented.
- A multi-Shop submission creates one `CheckoutBatch` and one independent Order per Shop. The batch groups the result for the Buyer; it is not a cross-Shop fulfillment record.
- The checkout address is selected from the Buyer Address Book and copied into each Order's immutable delivery snapshot.
- Current COD placement starts at `placed` with `payment_status = pending`; `pending_payment` remains a future payment-method status.
- Buyer checkout is not a Seller, Logistics, or Courier action. Seller acceptance, first-mile handoff, hub processing, waybill creation, delivery, returns, and refunds belong to their owning domains.
- **Downstream boundary:** Buyer checkout does not select Logistics. The Seller chooses one server-validated eligible LuboSmart dispatch operation when requesting pickup for prepared Orders; checkout continues to use the server-owned per-Shop quote.
- **Non-goals:** online payment, Buyer order editing/cancellation, shipment/parcel/waybill records, route selection, courier assignment, returns/refunds, or arbitrary address entry outside the Address Book contract.

```text
Buy Now or selected Cart lines
→ authenticated checkout
→ server resolves current catalog, stock, address, vouchers, and shipping quote
→ group by Shop
→ Buyer reviews quote
→ locked final validation + idempotency
→ one COD Order per Shop + snapshots + reservation
→ commit → private batch result
```

## MUST

### Authorization and input authority

- Require `auth:sanctum` and `buyer.active` for quote, placement, and batch retrieval.
- Resolve Buyer, Cart items, Products, Variants, SKUs, Shop, Address, vouchers, prices, availability, shipping, totals, and status from the server. Never trust client-supplied ownership, prices, stock, shipping fees, totals, snapshots, or status.
- Support exactly one mode: `cart` with unique Buyer-owned Cart item UUIDs, or `buy_now` with one Product, optional Variant, and positive quantity.
- Reject mixed modes, duplicate/empty selections, cross-Buyer IDs, hidden/restricted products, invalid variants, and unavailable stock with field-addressable `422`; use `409` for a stale quote/state conflict.

### Shop Order boundary

- Resolve every line from the current database Product and group by its Shop.
- Lines from one Shop are one Order; lines from different Shops are separate Orders with independent totals, lifecycle, reservations, and future fulfillment context.
- Persist `checkout_batch_id` on each created Order. Do not use the batch ID as a shipment or shared ownership key.
- Store immutable Order Item snapshots: Product/Variant IDs, names, selected option labels, SKU, unit price, quantity, line subtotal, and currency.
- Historical snapshots remain intact when a Product is edited, archived, restricted, or deleted.

### Address and downstream Logistics boundary

- Accept one `address_id` that belongs to the authenticated Buyer and is eligible for shipping (`shipping` or `both`). Revalidate completeness at quote and placement.
- Copy recipient, contact, address lines, PSGC/manual locality names, country, and optional coordinates into one `order_addresses` row per Order inside the placement transaction.
- Address Book edits/deletes never rewrite a placed Order snapshot.
- Manual/PSGC address fields are authoritative. Optional coordinates come from the Buyer's confirmed pin; provider IDs and suggestion payloads are not authoritative.
- Do not offer or accept a LuboSmart dispatch operation at checkout. The later Seller pickup contract validates and freezes that selection without rewriting the Buyer's Order/address/financial snapshots.

### COD, pricing, vouchers, and totals

- Accept only `payment_method = cod` in the MVP. The server creates `OrderStatus::Placed` and `PaymentStatus::Pending`; no gateway credential or payment secret is stored.
- Recalculate current prices, availability, Shop shipping quote, voucher eligibility, discounts, and payable totals for every quote and immediately before commit.
- Apply Shop vouchers only to their Shop Order. An App voucher in a multi-Shop checkout requires one explicit eligible Shop target; never silently move it.
- Use fixed-precision server money values. A discount cannot exceed its basis and shipping cannot become negative.
- Store immutable financial snapshots and voucher/redemption records on each Order.

### Inventory, transaction, and retry safety

- Cart quantity is not a reservation. At placement, lock relevant inventory rows in a stable order, recheck availability, then increment the exact `reserved` quantity.
- Create all Orders, items, address snapshots, voucher redemptions, inventory movements, and selected-Cart cleanup in one transaction. Any validation failure creates no partial batch and consumes no stock/voucher.
- A successful Cart placement removes only purchased selected lines; Buy Now does not mutate the Cart.
- Require a Buyer-scoped UUID `Idempotency-Key` on placement. A retry with the same request returns the original batch and does not duplicate Orders, reservations, redemptions, cleanup, or notifications.
- Reservation remains reserved until the approved first-mile event `picked_up_from_seller`; that later transition commits the reserved quantity to fulfilled inventory exactly once. An eligible cancellation or Seller rejection before that event releases only that Order's reservation once. Post-pickup return/refund/restoration and partial fulfillment remain deferred.
- Dispatch Seller/Buyer notifications after commit. Notification failure never rolls back a committed Order.

### Buyer experience and acceptance

- Buy Now and selected-Cart flows require an authenticated Buyer; a guest is redirected to login and must intentionally retry.
- Show one selected shipping-capable address, COD, each Shop group, items, current prices, voucher reasons, fees, savings, payable amount, loading, validation, stale, conflict, and retry states.
- A successful result lists every Order reference and links to Buyer Order Status. Partial-success UI is forbidden because placement is atomic.
- Use semantic labels, keyboard-operable controls, field-level errors, and non-color-only stock/error cues.
- [x] Buy Now creates a valid Order without adding a Cart line.
- [x] Selected Cart lines group by Shop and produce one Order per Shop.
- [x] Orders contain immutable item, address, financial, and voucher snapshots.
- [x] COD placement starts at `placed`/pending payment and reserves inventory transactionally.
- [x] Quote/place ownership, stale-state, rollback, and duplicate-retry paths are covered by API tests.
- [ ] Downstream Seller-selected dispatch operation and operational Shipment/Parcel records are implemented; checkout itself remains provider-neutral.

## HOW

### Current interfaces and implementation

- API routes are `POST /api/v1/buyer/checkout/quote`, `POST /api/v1/buyer/checkout/place` with a UUID `Idempotency-Key`, and `GET /api/v1/buyer/checkout/{batch}`.
- Laravel uses `CheckoutController`, `CheckoutService`, `CheckoutQuoteRequest`, `PlaceCheckoutRequest`, `CheckoutBatchResource`, `CheckoutBatch`, `CheckoutQuote`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `OrderAddress`, `OrderVoucher`, and `VoucherRedemption`.
- The additive checkout migration is `2026_08_30_000125_create_checkout_orders_and_vouchers.php`; enum-like columns remain string-backed with PHP enum casts.
- The storefront uses `/checkout`, the Product Detail Buy Now handoff, selected Cart handoff, saved-address selection, server requoting, and private `/checkout/result/{batchId}` confirmation.
- The frontend never calculates authoritative prices, stock, voucher savings, shipping fees, or totals.

### Data flow and verification

- Quote: normalize intent → resolve Buyer-owned inputs → group by Shop → calculate server totals/vouchers → save short-lived Buyer-owned quote with state/request hashes.
- Place: lock Buyer/quote/inventory/voucher rows → revalidate hashes and all rules → create Orders/snapshots/reservations → clear selected Cart lines → commit → queue after-commit notifications.
- Test ownership, one-/multi-Shop grouping, immutable snapshots, COD-only validation, restriction/availability changes, voucher targeting, rollback, stable locking, and idempotent retries on MySQL.
- Do not add migrations by editing an executed migration. Add a new migration when the approved Logistics selection or shared operational records are ready.

### Deferred work and references

- Define eligible-Logistics ranking, Seller pickup selection, and fulfillment persistence in `Documentation/features/orders/logistics-pickups/spec.md`; do not add that UI to Buyer checkout.
- Online payment, taxes/platform fees, return/refund policy, delivery failure, partial fulfillment, and Buyer order mutation remain open product decisions.
- Related contracts: `Documentation/features/buyer/address-book/spec.md`, `Documentation/features/buyer/order-status/spec.md`, Seller Order Approval/Prepare Orders, Inventory, and `Documentation/references/user-registration-requirements.md`.
