# Buyer Browse Seller Shops

## WHAT

- Provide a public Shop directory and a public, Seller-scoped storefront at `/shops/{slug}`.
- Let guests and signed-in Buyers discover active Shops, open a Shop, and browse that Shop's currently storefront-visible Products.
- Let a Buyer narrow the Shop's Products by the existing canonical Product Category taxonomy.
- The Phase 1 API and React directory/storefront pages are implemented and covered by focused tests.
- The route identity is `shops.slug`; it is globally unique in the implemented schema and is already emitted by Product Detail as `storefrontUrl`.
- A Shop has one Seller (`shops.seller_id` is unique); this feature never accepts a browser-supplied Seller ID as a scope.
- Reuse the existing `Product::storefrontVisible()` scope and `ProductSummaryResource`; public Shop browsing must have the same Product availability boundary as homepage, search, Product Detail, Cart, and Checkout.

- The Shop directory owns Shop discovery only. Product Detail owns Product detail and variant selection; Search owns marketplace-wide keyword search; Wishlist and Cart own their mutations; Seller Account Management owns Shop content and vacation mode.
- Shop Category classifies a Shop's business. Product Category is the canonical hierarchical taxonomy for Products; neither is a Seller-created category tree.
- This feature does not create Shop/Product CRUD, Seller ranking, reviews, messaging, vouchers, checkout, quick-add behavior, or a search-within-Shop field.

## MUST

### Public availability and privacy

- Both directory and Shop reads are guest-readable. A missing or non-public Shop returns the same `404` response so suspended/inactive Shop and Seller state is not disclosed.
- A public Shop is active, belongs to an active Seller with the Seller role, and is not on vacation. This must align with `Product::storefrontVisible()`.
- A vacation Shop is not browseable. Do not expose its vacation message through a separately reachable public Shop endpoint while its catalog is hidden.
- The public Shop DTO may contain only `id`, `slug`, `name`, `description`, `logoUrl`, `bannerUrl`, and safe Shop Category summary. Do not expose contact details, Seller profile details, payout data, documents, account status, Admin notes, compliance data, or storage paths.
- Product results are always built with `storefrontVisible()` and `where('products.shop_id', $shop->id)` (or the equivalent Shop relationship). Compliance-restricted, unpublished, archived, future-published, vacation, inactive-Shop, and inactive-Seller Products never appear.
- Product cards reuse the existing safe `ProductSummaryResource`; prices remain Laravel-authoritative snapshots. Product Detail, Cart, and Checkout independently revalidate current visibility, price, variant, and stock.
- Public responses must not contain Buyer-specific Wishlist, Cart, address, order, or session data. `Vary` and caching must not permit a shared response to leak private state.

### Directory

- `GET /api/v1/buyer/shops` returns paginated public Shop summaries, newest stable order by default, with `page` and bounded `limit` validation consistent with Product Search (`limit` 8–50, default 20).
- The only initial directory filter is optional `shop_category` by canonical Shop Category slug. It accepts one value, validates that the category is active, and returns `422` for malformed/unknown values.
- Do not introduce popularity, rating, distance, promoted placement, or arbitrary client-driven sorting until their authoritative data and rules exist.
- A directory page has loading, populated, empty, invalid-filter, API-error/retry, and accessible pagination states. It must link to the canonical Shop URL.

### Shop storefront

- `GET /api/v1/buyer/shops/{slug}` resolves the public Shop header. `GET /api/v1/buyer/shops/{slug}/products` returns its paginated Products and available category filters.
- The Products endpoint accepts optional `category` Product Category slug, `page`, and `limit`; it rejects unrecognised query keys and invalid values with the repository's normal validation response.
- Category options are distinct active Product Categories attached to this Shop's storefront-visible Products, ordered by taxonomy `position`, then name. Categories with no visible Shop Product are omitted.
- A supplied category must be one of those Shop category options. It must never widen the query to another Shop, even if its global slug is valid.
- The initial product order is deterministic: newest publication first with Product UUID as the tie breaker. Do not expose product sort controls until allowed sort semantics are approved.
- Products remain paginated. Preserve valid query parameters in pagination links and in the browser URL: `/shops/{slug}?category={category}&page={page}`.
- A Shop with no visible Products is a valid Shop response with an explicit empty-catalogue state. A valid selected category with no Products should normally be impossible because options are derived from visible Products; handle it safely if state becomes stale.
- Product cards link to the existing canonical `/products/{id}` page. They may reuse the existing Wishlist control; variant-dependent Add to Cart remains on Product Detail.

### HTTP response and freshness rules

- Successful collection responses return an `items` array and the standard pagination object. The Shop-products response also returns the resolved safe Shop header and the derived category options so they share one authoritative scope.
- Use `404` only for the route identity/public-availability boundary and `422` only for invalid validated parameters; do not turn an empty catalogue into an error.
- Do not add an authenticated-only endpoint or a React proxy that repeats Laravel's public visibility logic.
- Set an explicit short public cache policy consistent with Product Search. Any authenticated private enrichment must be `no-store` and separate.
- Changes to Shop status/vacation, Seller active status, Product publication/archive, Product compliance restriction, visible price/media, or Product category must make affected Shop browse responses stale promptly.
- A stale page can never authorize a Cart or Checkout mutation; those services retain their existing transactional validation.

### Buyer experience and accessibility

- The implemented `/shops` and `/shops/[slug]` pages use the existing React App Router, shared Laravel API client, and marketplace header/product-card patterns.
- Read directory/filter/page query state on the server page and use a small client control only to change URL parameters. Reset `page` to `1` when changing a category.
- Render Shop name as the page `h1`; give category controls a visible label, semantic buttons or links, an announced selected state, and keyboard support.
- Use meaningful Shop/logo/banner alt text, maintain focus after filter or pagination navigation, and distinguish not-found, empty directory, empty catalogue, validation, loading, and retriable service-error states.
- Generate canonical metadata for `/shops/{slug}` from the safe Shop DTO. Do not emit structured data for unavailable Shops or infer ratings/reviews.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Guests and authenticated Buyers can paginate the public Shop directory and open an active Shop by its slug.
- [x] A non-existent, inactive, suspended, or vacation Shop has no public browse response.
- [x] Every Shop Product belongs to the resolved Shop; query manipulation cannot reveal another Shop's Product or category.
- [x] The directory and Shop list exclude every Product excluded by `storefrontVisible()`, including active compliance restrictions.
- [x] Only active, visible Product Categories appear as Shop filters, and a selected filter remains Seller/Shop-scoped.
- [x] Product pagination is bounded, deterministic, and retains valid URL state.
- [x] Public DTOs contain no private Seller, Admin, or Buyer information and do not expose raw media paths.
- [x] The Buyer UI has responsive, keyboard-accessible loading, empty, not-found, validation, and retry states.

## HOW

### API and data flow

- `ShopBrowseController`, `ShopDirectoryRequest`, `ShopProductsRequest`, `ShopSummaryResource`, `ShopDetailResource`, and `ShopCategorySummaryResource` implement the public contract; Product cards reuse `ProductSummaryResource`.
- `ShopBrowseService` resolves public Shops by slug and composes `Product::query()->storefrontVisible()->where('shop_id', $shop->id)` before category filtering and pagination.
- The service eager-loads only the Shop/category/media relationships required by the DTOs and Product cards. A query-count regression test verifies that page size does not create N+1 growth.
- Category options are derived from the final visible Shop Product scope, and the selected category is resolved from those Shop-scoped options rather than trusted from client input.
- The API returns the Product Search-compatible pagination fields `currentPage`, `lastPage`, `perPage`, and `total` using bounded page pagination.
- Public API responses and React server fetches use a 60-second cache window. Cache identity includes the endpoint, Shop slug/ID, validated category, page, and limit; Cart and Checkout still revalidate visibility and stock before mutation.

### Buyer application

- Typed `ShopSummary`, `ShopDetail`, `ShopDirectoryResponse`, `ShopBrowseResponse`, and shared server API helpers live under `resources/js/lib/marketplace/`.
- `resources/js/app/shops/page.tsx` implements the directory; `resources/js/app/shops/[slug]/page.tsx` implements the storefront, with route-level loading and not-found states.
- The pages reuse `MarketplaceHeader`, `ProductCard`, responsive image handling, Product Detail links, and focused Shop header/card/filter/pagination components.
- Public data is fetched without Buyer credentials. Wishlist controls remain separate Product-card behavior and do not alter the cached public Shop payload.

### Validation and tests

- Laravel feature tests: public guest access; active Shop lookup; indistinguishable unavailable `404`; Seller/Shop scope isolation; Product visibility/compliance/vacation exclusions; category derivation and validation; pagination bounds/order; safe resources; and no N+1 regression for a representative list.
- Buyer tests: directory and Shop routing; query-string category/page behavior; Product Detail navigation; loading, empty, `404`, validation, and retry rendering; responsive controls; keyboard navigation and labelled filter state.
- Focused API coverage exists in `BuyerBrowseShopTest` for public access, unavailable-Shop boundaries, visibility, scope isolation, validation, pagination, safe resources, and query-count stability. Buyer routing, URL state, accessibility, loading, empty, not-found, validation, and retry behavior is implemented in the Shop pages.
- Run the focused API tests and Buyer lint, strict JavaScript, and production build when this implementation changes. Append an accurate dated `Documentation/PROGRESS.md` entry after runtime changes; this revision only corrects the specification metadata and implementation description.

### Deferred enhancements and maintenance choices

- The current Shop cards display the safe banner, logo, name, active Shop Category, and optional description. Any density or presentation change belongs in a UI revision, not a new API contract.
- The API and UI use a default page size of 20 within the validated 8–50 range. A different default requires coordinated API/UI and test changes.
- The current public cache window is 60 seconds. If freshness requirements change, update the cache contract and invalidation strategy before changing the TTL.
- Add Shop ratings, in-Shop keyword search, sorting, vouchers, and Shop-following only through their own approved specifications and authoritative data contracts.
