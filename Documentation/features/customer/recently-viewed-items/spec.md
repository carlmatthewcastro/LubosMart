# Buyer Recently Viewed Items

## WHAT

- Passively record a Product only after a Buyer or guest successfully opens its canonical Product Detail page, then show it in most-recent-first order.
- Support a small best-effort guest history in first-party browser storage and durable, cross-device history for an authenticated active Buyer.
- The Phase 1 Laravel API, Product Detail recorder, homepage rail, guest storage, and protected Account history page are implemented and covered by focused API coverage.
- Complete the existing foundation instead of introducing a new history model: `recently_viewed_products` already has UUID `id`, `user_id`, `product_id`, `last_viewed_at`, unique (`user_id`, `product_id`), and the index used for recency reads.
- The homepage already consumes authenticated history through `HomepageService` and displays up to the configured `homepage.recently_viewed_limit` (currently 12); it must remain a presentation consumer, not its own tracker.

- Recently Viewed is passive behavioural history, not Wishlist intent, Cart state, an inventory reservation, a recommendation score, analytics/pageview logging, or Seller/Admin-visible data.
- Product Detail owns the moment of a valid visit. Search, Homepage, Browse Shop, and Product Card impressions must not create a view.
- Product visibility stays owned by the canonical `Product::storefrontVisible()` scope. Current Product data comes from `ProductSummaryResource`, not a historical Product snapshot.
- The MVP includes the homepage rail and protected `/account/recently-viewed` history page. It does not add recommendations, marketing messages, Seller analytics, Redis, or real-time cross-device updates.

## MUST

### Identity, recording, and retention

- An authenticated record is always scoped to the active Buyer resolved from Sanctum; the browser never submits `user_id`.
- `PUT /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed/{product}` resolves the Product through `storefrontVisible()`, inserts or updates its one Buyer/Product row, and sets `last_viewed_at` from Laravel's UTC clock.
- Reopening the same Product updates recency without creating a second logical row. Use the existing unique key with a transaction-safe upsert/update-or-create pattern.
- A Product Detail client-only recorder runs once after the server-rendered Product is successfully resolved. It must guard against React remounts, retries, and development Strict Mode duplicate effects; backend idempotency remains mandatory.
- Product variants do not create separate history records because the browseable identity is Product, not SKU/variant.
- Keep no more than 50 distinct authenticated records per Buyer, pruning the oldest records after successful record or merge. Make this limit configuration-backed.
- The existing homepage remains capped independently at 12 (or its configured value); the Account page uses cursor pagination over the retained history.

### Guest history

- A guest visit records only `{ productId, viewedAt }` in a versioned first-party `localStorage` key. Keep at most 12 distinct Product IDs and move a revisited Product to the front.
- Do not store Product DTOs, images, prices, names, search terms, identifiers for an account, tokens, addresses, payment data, or any Seller-private data in browser history.
- Read/write storage only from client code. Feature-detect access and catch security/quota/parse errors; Product Detail and normal shopping must work when storage is absent, blocked, corrupt, or cleared.
- Guest entries are display hints, not authority. Before they become cards, submit only their bounded IDs to a public Product-summary resolver and retain returned Products in requested recency order.
- `localStorage` is same-origin and persists across ordinary sessions but can be cleared or unavailable; private browsing may clear it when the private session ends. Treat guest history as best effort. [MDN Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Documentation/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)

### Authentication merge and logout

- After a successful Buyer session restoration or login, submit the bounded guest list once to `POST /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed/merge`; authentication success must not wait for, or fail because of, the merge.
- Laravel validates UUID shape, maximum item count, duplicate IDs, and an optional bounded client timestamp; it resolves only storefront-visible Products and ignores invalid, missing, hidden, or malformed entries.
- Merge deduplicates by Product ID, retains the later credible timestamp when it is not in the future, upserts Buyer-scoped rows, prunes retention, and is safe to retry.
- On merge success, replace or clear the guest key with the canonical result. On failure, retain the local list for a later retry without claiming that it synced.
- Logout never deletes server history and must not copy a Buyer's complete server history into guest storage.

### Reading, removal, and privacy

- `GET /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed?cursor=&limit=` returns authenticated history newest first, joined to Products filtered by `storefrontVisible()`, with safe Product card data, `lastViewedAt`, and opaque cursor pagination.
- The public resolver accepts at most 12 UUIDs and returns only `storefrontVisible()` Product cards; it must not expose another Buyer's history or accept arbitrary filters.
- Hidden, unpublished, compliance-restricted, vacation, inactive-Shop, inactive-Seller, or deleted Products are omitted from both authenticated and guest display. Retained database rows may stay until normal pruning; do not leak their old title, price, image, or reason.
- `DELETE /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed/{product}` removes only the current Buyer's record and is idempotent. `DELETE /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed` clears only that Buyer's history.
- The Account page provides remove-one and clear-all controls with confirmation for clear-all. Guest equivalents alter only local storage and do not affect a later authenticated history.
- Responses are private and `no-store`. Do not put Buyer history in the shared homepage cache, logs, analytics events, notifications, or Seller/Admin APIs.

### Buyer experience and accessibility

- Homepage renders the existing Recently Viewed rail only when it has valid Products. Guests hydrate their resolved local items in a client boundary; signed-in Buyers use the authenticated history contract without leaking it into SSR shared cache.
- Add `/account/recently-viewed` behind existing Buyer protected routing, with cursor load-more, refresh on focus/reconnect, Product Detail links, Wishlist reuse, and no variant quick-add.
- Use current Product prices, stock labels, image fallbacks, and availability from `ProductSummaryResource`; Cart/Wishlist retain their own validation and mutations.
- Provide loading, empty, storage-unavailable, resolver/API-error with retry, merge-pending/failed, and stale-item-removed states without interrupting Product Detail.
- Use a semantic section/page heading; ensure Product links, remove controls, clear confirmation, rail controls, focus changes, and status feedback are keyboard accessible and announced without relying on colour.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Opening a visible Product Detail records one recency entry; cards, searches, rails, hovers, and variants do not.
- [x] Repeated visits update `last_viewed_at`, keep one Buyer/Product record, and put that Product first.
- [x] An unauthenticated visitor stores only a bounded minimal local history and continues shopping when browser storage fails.
- [x] Login/session merge validates, deduplicates, bounds, and retries safely without delaying authentication.
- [x] Authenticated history is Buyer-scoped, persistent across normal-device refreshes, and never exposes `user_id` control to the client.
- [x] Guest and Buyer displays omit every Product excluded by `storefrontVisible()` and use current safe Product card data.
- [x] Homepage and Account page use the owning history API/data model; personalized data is never shared-cached.
- [x] Remove-one and clear-all affect only the current Buyer or current guest browser as applicable.

## HOW

### Laravel API and persistence

- The existing `RecentlyViewedProduct` model, migration, relationships, unique constraint, and `last_viewed_at` naming are the durable persistence contract. No migration change is needed for Phase 1.
- Buyer-active routes, `RecentlyViewedController`, form requests, and `RecentlyViewedService` implement record, merge, list, remove, and clear operations.
- Route set:

  ```http
  GET    /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed
  PUT    /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed/{product}
  POST   /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed/merge
  DELETE /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed/{product}
  DELETE /api/v1/buyer/recently-viewed
  POST   /api/v1/buyer/products/resolve
  ```

- The resolver is public, rate-limited, validates a bounded `productIds` array, loads `shop`/`galleryMedia` eagerly, and returns `ProductSummaryResource` in request order after visibility filtering.
- The authenticated list loads `product.shop` and `product.galleryMedia` in bounded cursor order and maps each record to `{ product, lastViewedAt }`; avoid N+1 queries and raw model serialization.
- Reuse the service/query composition in `HomepageService` where practical, so homepage and Account history cannot disagree about scope or ordering.
- Do not add Redis. The database is already the durable source for Buyer history and browser storage is sufficient for this bounded school-project feature.

### Buyer application

- The browser-only `recently-viewed-storage` utility performs parse/version validation, deduplication, capping, recording, clearing, and safe failure handling.
- `ProductViewRecorder` beside `ProductConfigurator` records locally for guests or calls the authenticated endpoint, while `RecentlyViewedProvider` performs a best-effort guest merge after authentication is confirmed.
- Authenticated API helpers and types under `resources/js/lib/marketplace/` use a private `no-store` request path distinct from public discovery helpers.
- `RecentlyViewedSection` omits itself when empty, hydrates guest cards after mount, and uses `ProductRail` for accessible cards; the protected Account page provides cursor pagination, remove, clear, retry, and optimistic UI.

### Validation, testing, and rollout

- Laravel tests: Buyer role/status enforcement; Product visibility; upsert/recency; concurrent/retried writes; retention pruning; merge validation/order/idempotency; cursor scope; delete/clear isolation; safe DTOs; resolver bound/order; and no N+1 representative list.
- Buyer tests: Product Detail recording once; guest storage unavailable/corrupt; stale resolver omissions; merge success/failure; Account protection/list/remove/clear; homepage guest/auth states; focus/retry; and keyboard/announced feedback.
- `BuyerRecentlyViewedTest` covers Buyer role/status gates, visible-product recording, upsert/recency, retention, merge validation and idempotency, cursor scoping, delete/clear isolation, safe resources, resolver bounds/order, and query-count stability. The Buyer pages implement the guest/authenticated states, retries, focus/reconnect refresh, and accessible controls.
- Run focused API tests plus Buyer lint, strict JavaScript, and production build when runtime behavior changes. This revision only corrects the specification metadata and implementation description.

### Deferred enhancements and maintenance choices

- The Account page currently displays a human-readable `Viewed` timestamp in addition to newest-first ordering.
- Retention and request bounds are configuration-backed by `recently-viewed.retention_limit`, `merge_limit`, `resolver_limit`, `default_page_size`, `max_page_size`, and `client_timestamp_max_age_days`; the current guest limit is the client constant `guestRecentlyViewedLimit` (12).
- A privacy/settings control to disable future tracking remains deferred. It would require a separate persisted preference and must not be implied by clear-all.
- Recommendations, marketing messages, Seller analytics, notifications, Redis, and real-time cross-device updates remain outside this Phase 1 contract.
