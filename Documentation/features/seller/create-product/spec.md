# Seller Create Product

## WHAT

- Give an approved Seller a guided, Shop-scoped form for creating a product draft.
- Capture the catalog data consumed by Buyer product cards and the `/products/{id}` detail page:
  - name, category, short description, Markdown description, specifications, media, and pricing;
  - zero or more option groups and values;
  - manually selected SKU-backed variants, with stock and optional price overrides; a Seller may list only the combinations they actually sell.
- Save incomplete work as a draft, then allow a separate publish action after catalog and compliance checks pass.
- Product prices are seller-entered regular selling prices. A variant may override the parent price and original price; when omitted, it inherits the parent value.
- The form lives in `resources/js/seller` (React/Vite). `resources/js/webapp` remains the Buyer read-only renderer and must not expose Seller creation controls.
- Non-goals: order fulfillment, promotions/vouchers, payment, direct inventory ledger edits, hard deletion, product bundles, video, or arbitrary HTML/MDX execution.

## MUST

### Access, ownership, and lifecycle

- Require an authenticated, active, Admin-approved Seller; derive the Seller's authoritative Shop from the session.
- Scope every product, option, variant, SKU, gallery asset, and description asset query to that Shop. Never accept client-supplied seller or shop ownership.
- Create products as `draft`; drafts are visible to their Seller only and never appear in Buyer listing/detail APIs.
- Preserve the existing lifecycle: Seller saves draft, edits draft, explicitly publishes, or archives. Archive is recoverable and does not delete catalog history.
- Use `401` for unauthenticated, `403` for role/approval failure, `404` for an out-of-scope product, `422` for validation, and `409` for stale or invalid lifecycle transitions.

### Product and variant data

- Require a product name, active category belonging to the Shop's canonical Shop Category, base SKU, and positive base price; short description is optional and bounded.
- Store fixed-precision monetary values with an explicit currency. `original_price`, including a variant override, is optional but cannot be lower than its effective selling price.
- Support no variants (the base SKU is purchasable) or ordered option groups such as Color and Size.
- Require each submitted variant to select exactly one value from every option group; reject duplicates, partial selections, duplicate combinations, and SKUs reused anywhere the API forbids them. Option groups may contain values that do not yet have a Seller-created variant.
- Each variant has an SKU, active/inactive state, and authoritative inventory SKU. Opening stock may be supplied once while creating each SKU through the Inventory service; persisted stock is read-only in Product UI and is adjusted only through Inventory. Updating a variant or its option selection retains the same variant and inventory SKU; deleting a variant soft-deletes it and deactivates its inventory SKU while retaining its stock ledger and order references.
- Expose effective variant price/original price as `variant value ?? product value`; the Buyer detail contract must show the selected variant's price, SKU, and availability.
- Prevent publishing when required product data, valid combinations, required media, compliance state, or any later configured shipping/dimension requirement is incomplete.

### Markdown description and images

- Use `@mdxeditor/editor` as a controlled Seller `ProductDescriptionEditor` bound to `description_markdown`.
- Initialize only the required editor plugins: headings, lists, quote, links/link dialog, thematic break, Markdown shortcuts, image, and toolbar; include `InsertImage`.
- Support image add, paste, and drag/drop using MDXEditor's `imagePlugin({ imageUploadHandler })`; each file is uploaded immediately to the authorized Laravel endpoint and the returned canonical URL is inserted into Markdown.
- Do not store Base64, `blob:` URLs, browser paths, expiring signed URLs, arbitrary external image URLs, raw HTML, JSX, or executable MDX in the description.
- Keep inline description assets separate from Product gallery/variant media. A description image must never alter Buyer gallery ordering or become a variant primary image.
- Apply `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`: server-inspect and decode JPEG/JPG/PNG/WebP only, under 10 MiB, with generated object keys, metadata, ownership, scan state, and safe delivery.
- Block insertion/publication for pending, failed, malformed, oversized, cross-Product, or unapproved assets; show truthful upload progress, retry, and field-addressable errors.
- Bound Markdown length, image count, alt text, links, and allowed nodes server-side. Buyer rendering remains GFM-safe with `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`, without `rehype-raw`.

### Frontend initialization and UX

- Keep MDXEditor in a Seller client component and import its stylesheet once. The Vite `resources/js/main.tsx` bootstrap must mount the editor through the existing `StrictMode`, `BrowserRouter`, and `AuthProvider` tree without browser-global access during module initialization.
- If an MDXEditor component is ever imported into the React `resources/js/webapp`, wrap it in a client-only boundary and `next/dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`, and initialize its plugins in that client-only module. Do not put the editor in the server-rendered Buyer product page.
- The Seller form must expose labeled controls, keyboard-operable toolbar/dialog/drop zone, visible focus, non-color upload states, unsaved-change protection, loading/error/empty states, and mobile-safe layout.
- Disable description-image upload until the draft has a persisted UUID; explain that the Seller must save the draft first.
- Add and delete variant rows manually, let each row select one value per option group, preserve existing rows when option values are added, show inherited versus overridden prices, collect opening stock per new SKU, prevent duplicate combinations, and make persisted stock read-only except through Inventory management.

### Buyer listing compatibility

- Keep `name`, `short_description`, effective base price, original price, stock, status, published timestamp, thumbnail, rating, sold count, and badges compatible with the existing Buyer summary DTO.
- Buyer discovery/detail must require an active published Product, active approved Seller, active Shop, non-vacation Shop, and positive availability where the existing listing contract requires it.
- Never expose draft form state, Seller-only costs, private asset paths, inactive variants, or unapproved description images in Buyer responses.
- A product with variants must not advertise a misleading single price: the DTO may expose the configured base/range presentation, while a selected variant exposes its authoritative effective price.
- Show gallery files as an ordered filename list with per-file removal and a Seller-controlled `Set as default` action. The selected approved product-level gallery image is the Buyer card thumbnail; if no selection is supplied, the first gallery image becomes the default.
- Product and variant price changes are authoritative at read/cart/checkout time; the form must not promise that a displayed price reserves stock.

### Data contract and validation edges

- Product detail responses must return stable UUIDs, ordered option groups/values, variant-to-value mappings, effective prices, SKU identifiers, availability, and media references without leaking Eloquent internals.
- The create/update payload must distinguish omitted nullable override prices from explicit values and must reject numeric strings that exceed the persisted decimal precision.
- Normalize SKU input consistently with current Seller behavior, preserve the canonical product slug policy, and keep category IDs as UUIDs.
- Validate option names/values after trimming, reject blank labels and duplicate case-insensitive labels where the product contract requires uniqueness, and preserve display positions deterministically.
- A zero-stock variant may remain in the Seller draft matrix but cannot satisfy Buyer purchase availability or publish requirements if the product has no purchasable combination.
- Deleting an option group or value must update each existing row's selections or leave it visibly invalid for server validation; it must not silently remove unrelated variant rows.
- Retrying a request must not create duplicate products, variants, assets, or inventory movements; use idempotency where an upload or multi-row mutation can be retried.
- Server validation is authoritative even when the UI has already generated a valid-looking matrix or accepted a browser-side image preview.

### Security and failure handling

- Reject path traversal, storage-disk injection, malformed UUIDs, unknown fields, unsafe Markdown links, and asset URLs that point outside the LuboSmart canonical route.
- Do not reveal whether an out-of-scope UUID exists; return the same scoped not-found behavior for another Shop's product or asset.
- On a failed multi-row save, return field paths such as `variants.2.price` and preserve the Seller's unsaved local form state for correction.
- If an asset is uploaded before the product save later fails, keep it unattached and eligible for the documented cleanup/retention process; do not silently attach it to another product.
- If a published product is edited, invalidate affected Buyer caches only after the database transaction commits and keep existing order snapshots immutable.

## HOW

- Extend the existing Seller product endpoints or introduce product actions/resources while preserving `/api/v1/seller/products` conventions:
  - `POST /products` creates the draft and base SKU;
  - `PATCH /products/{product}` updates editable product fields;
  - nested create/update/delete endpoints persist option groups, values, variants, and media atomically;
  - `POST /products/{product}/description-assets` uploads one description image;
  - publish/archive remain explicit actions.
- Add Form Requests, policies, scoped queries, and API Resources. Recheck Shop ownership and category membership server-side for every nested write.
- Use additive migrations only. Keep enum-like columns as migration strings with PHP enum casts. Add a feature-specific description-asset record containing UUID, product, disk/path, detected MIME, size, dimensions, checksum, scan status, and timestamps.
- Persist files on the configured filesystem/blob disk and metadata in MySQL. Return asset identifiers or safe delivery URLs, never raw storage paths.
- Implement product writes in a transaction; perform image validation/storage/scanning outside long database locks, then attach only approved assets. Queue cache/search refresh after commit.
- Update `resources/js/seller` types, API client, routes, form components, editor, variant matrix, and tests. Keep `resources/js/webapp`'s existing product-detail Markdown renderer initialized with `react-markdown`/`remark-gfm` and add the canonical description-image URL policy there.
- Test API role/approval/tenant isolation, price inheritance and overrides, valid-combination enforcement, SKU uniqueness, draft/publish gates, upload spoofing and 10 MiB boundary, scan state, and safe asset delivery.
- Test Seller UI editor initialization, toolbar/paste/drop insertion, progress/retry, draft gating, variant price editing, accessibility, persistence, and stale-save errors; run API tests plus Seller and Webapp lint, JavaScript, and production builds.
- Add acceptance tests for these user-visible outcomes:
  - [ ] An approved Seller creates a draft with no variants and sees its base SKU and price in the Seller list.
  - [ ] A Seller creates Color × Size combinations; each combination has one SKU, stock identity, and either an override price or inherited product price.
  - [ ] Duplicate, incomplete, cross-Shop, negative, or invalid-price combinations receive field-specific errors and do not partially persist.
  - [ ] Toolbar insertion, paste, and drag/drop each upload a valid image, insert the canonical reference, and render it in authorized Seller preview.
  - [ ] A rejected upload never appears in Markdown and an interrupted upload can be retried without duplicating the image reference.
  - [ ] A published product is returned by Buyer listing/detail only when every existing visibility predicate passes.
- Observe upload success/failure, scan latency, rejected MIME/size reasons, product-save conflicts, publish failures, and Buyer image-delivery failures using asset/product IDs only; never log Markdown, file contents, private URLs, or credentials.
- Roll out additive schema/API changes first, then the Seller editor and variant matrix, then enable publish gating and Buyer asset delivery. Existing base products must remain readable and retain their current summary behavior.

### Resolved implementation decisions (2026-09-02)

- Variant `price` and `original_price` are nullable overrides. A missing value inherits its Product parent value.
- A Product gallery defaults to 10 images. Each Variant may have one separate primary image; Variant images do not consume the gallery allowance. The limit is environment-backed now so a future Admin global setting can become authoritative without changing the upload contract.
- The Seller gallery renders filenames rather than image previews. Sellers may remove temporary gallery uploads and select one product-level gallery image as the default cover; new Products default to the first gallery image when no selection is made.
- Accepted images remain under 10 MiB and are additionally limited to 8,000 pixels per edge and 40 megapixels. This follows OWASP's resource-limit guidance and stays below ImageMagick's documented 8,192-pixel security-policy example.
- Pre-save MDXEditor/gallery/Variant uploads use a Shop-owned `product-assets/temp` prefix and expire after 24 hours. Saving the Product moves claimed blobs into the Product folder. Replaced gallery, Variant, or description revisions have a 24-hour grace period. Deleted Products retain image blobs for 30 days by default, configurable from 7 through 30 days.
- `products:cleanup-assets` runs hourly through Laravel's scheduler and removes expired temporary uploads and retention-expired blobs. Product rows remain soft-deleted tombstones so Order/catalog history is not coupled to blob deletion.
- Base and Variant SKUs are unique within a Shop, not across the marketplace.
- Category-specific specification keys and an external malware-scan provider remain separate future decisions; the current synchronous approval step performs signature/type checks, bounded decoding, and image rewriting before an asset becomes usable.
