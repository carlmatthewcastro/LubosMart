system: LUBOSMART
type: Feature Specification
version: 1.0
status: Draft
scope: React Courier Mobile Application / Delivery Exception Handling
source_coverage: Courier.md, app.md

# Incident Reporting Specification
## 1. Purpose
Incident Reporting is LUBOSMART's Courier exception-handling feature for reporting operational blockers that prevent or materially interfere with successful delivery.
`Courier.md` defines:
```text
Core Value:
Flag vehicle breakdowns,
accidents,
or inaccessible delivery addresses
to Logistics.
```
Expanded definition:
```text
An exception-handling system
for logistics failures.

It allows couriers
to log blockers
that prevent successful delivery,

effectively pausing
Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

and immediately notifying
the central dispatch team.
```
System context:
```text
Creates an Incident record
tied to the active delivery task,

which can trigger
automated re-routing logic
or alert support teams.
```
Incident Reporting therefore owns the Courier-side creation of a delivery exception record and the handoff of that exception to Logistics/dispatch/support.
A separate `flow.md` is required because the feature has a meaningful stateful sequence:
```text
active delivery
→ blocker occurs
→ Courier reports incident
→ Incident record created
→ dispatch/support notified
→ delivery handling changes according to incident policy
→ incident later resolved outside the basic Rider report step
```
## 2. Primary Actor
Primary actor:
```text
COURIER / RIDER
```
The Courier reports incidents through the React mobile application.
## 3. Primary Operational Recipient
Source-backed recipient:
```text
LOGISTICS
```
Specifically:
```text
central dispatch team
```
and potentially:
```text
support teams
```
## 4. Authentication
Courier mobile authentication follows `app.md`:
```text
React
→ personal access token
→ OS secure storage

Requests:
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Every Incident Reporting request must resolve:
```text
authenticated user_id
+
COURIER role
```
## 5. Identity Rule
LUBOSMART uses:
```text
unique(email, role)
```
Incident ownership must be based on the exact authenticated Courier account.
A same-email Buyer/Seller/authorized Admin dispatch account is a separate logical role account.
# Responsibility and Boundaries
## 6. Incident Reporting Owns
Incident Reporting owns:
- reporting blockers during active delivery work
- source-backed incident categories
- creating an `Incident` record
- linking the Incident to the active delivery task
- linking the reporting Courier
- capturing incident time
- capturing incident description/details
- notifying Logistics/central dispatch
- exposing incident status to the Courier where useful
- providing data that may influence SLA handling
- providing data that may trigger rerouting/support workflows
- preventing unauthorized incident creation
- preserving incident history
## 7. Incident Reporting Does Not Own
It does not own:
- initial delivery assignment
- parcel pickup confirmation
- route optimization itself
- direct vehicle repair
- police/emergency-services dispatch
- final incident resolution by Logistics
- automatic order cancellation
- refund decisions
- payout calculation
- Proof of Delivery
- final `DELIVERED` mutation
- SOS emergency workflow
- general Chat/Messaging
## 8. Core Boundary
Incident Reporting answers:
```text
What operational blocker
is preventing this delivery
from proceeding normally?
```
It does not independently answer:
```text
How should Logistics finally resolve it?
```
# Source-Backed Incident Types
## 9. Vehicle Breakdown
Source-backed:
```text
vehicle breakdown
```
Examples are not further defined.
The source does not define:
```text
flat tire
engine failure
battery failure
fuel issue
```
as separate required types.
Open Decision.
## 10. Accident
Source-backed:
```text
accident
```
The source does not define severity levels.
Open Decision.
## 11. Inaccessible Delivery Address
Source-backed:
```text
inaccessible delivery address
```
This may cover a delivery location the Courier cannot physically access.
Exact subtypes are Open.
## 12. Additional Incident Types
The source does not enumerate additional categories.
Do not invent a large mandatory incident taxonomy.
Possible future categories remain an Open Decision.
# Active Delivery Task Link
## 13. Source Requirement
Each Incident is:
```text
tied to the active delivery task
```
## 14. Required Relationship
Conceptually:
```text
Incident
→ delivery_task_id
```
or equivalent active-shipment relation.
## 15. Courier Relationship
The Incident must preserve:
```text
courier_id
```
for the reporting Courier.
## 16. Order Relationship
If the delivery task references an Order, the Incident may be resolved to:
```text
order_id
```
through the task.
A direct `order_id` field is optional depending on schema.
## 17. No Arbitrary Task
The Courier must not create an Incident for an unrelated delivery task.
# Active-Task Eligibility
## 18. Active Delivery Requirement
The source explicitly ties Incident Reporting to:
```text
the active delivery task
```
## 19. Relevant Lifecycle
Likely incident-eligible states include active phases such as:
```text
ACCEPTED
IN_TRANSIT
```
depending on final delivery-task state machine.
The exact eligible states are Open.
## 20. Completed Delivery
A task already:
```text
COMPLETED
```
or associated Order already:
```text
DELIVERED
```
should generally not accept a new normal delivery Incident through this workflow.
Post-delivery dispute/reporting is a separate concern.
# Incident Record
## 21. Source Entity
The source explicitly names:
```text
Incident
```
## 22. Recommended Fields
Conceptually:
```text
id
delivery_task_id
courier_id
type
description
reported_at
status
created_at
updated_at
```
Exact schema is Open.
## 23. Description
Courier should be able to provide enough detail for Logistics to understand the blocker.
## 24. Description Requirement
Whether free-text description is mandatory for every category is Open.
Recommended:
```text
require concise incident description
```
for operational usefulness.
## 25. Timestamp
Use an authoritative server timestamp for:
```text
reported_at
```
## 26. Client Timestamp
Device timestamp may be useful as metadata but should not be authoritative.
# Incident Status
## 27. Source Boundary
`Courier.md` does not define an Incident status enum.
## 28. Recommended Minimal States
Possible:
```text
OPEN
ACKNOWLEDGED
RESOLVED
```
These are recommendations only.
## 29. Resolution Ownership
The Courier reports the Incident.
Logistics/support should generally own:
```text
acknowledgement
resolution
reroute decision
```
Exact ownership is Open.
## 30. Courier Self-Resolution
Whether the Courier may mark an Incident resolved is not defined.
Open Decision.
# SLA Handling
## 31. Source Requirement
The Expanded Definition says Incident Reporting:
```text
effectively pauses
Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
```
## 32. Interpretation
An active Incident may affect SLA measurement so the Courier is not treated as operating normally while a documented blocker exists.
## 33. Exact SLA Rule
The source does not define:
```text
which SLA timer
when pause begins
when pause ends
whether all incidents pause
whether approval is required
```
Open Decision.
## 34. No Invented Timer Math
Do not invent:
```text
SLA + 30 minutes
automatic grace period
specific penalty removal
```
without requirements.
## 35. Recommended SLA Event
Recommended architecture:
```text
Incident created
→ SLA subsystem receives exception event
→ applies configured pause/exception policy
```
Incident Reporting should not independently implement all SLA calculations.
# Immediate Dispatch Notification
## 36. Source Requirement
Incident creation should:
```text
immediately notify
the central dispatch team
```
## 37. Notification Target
Primary target:
```text
Logistics / central dispatch
```
## 38. Notification Event
Recommended:
```text
Incident created
→ durable dispatch notification event
```
## 39. Notification Content
Recommended safe operational payload:
```text
incident_id
delivery_task_id
courier identity/reference
incident type
reported_at
short description
```
## 40. Notification Channel
The source does not define:
```text
WebSocket
Push
email
SMS
webhook
```
for Incident Reporting.
Open Decision.
## 41. Internal Realtime
LUBOSMART may use its existing backend/realtime mechanisms to surface Incidents to the Admin dispatch dashboard.
No new hosted provider is required.
## 42. Notification Failure
If Incident creation commits but immediate realtime notification fails:
```text
Incident must remain stored
→ Logistics can retrieve it
→ notification retry may occur
```
Do not discard the Incident.
# Automated Rerouting
## 43. Source Capability
`Courier.md` says an Incident:
```text
can trigger
automated re-routing logic
```
## 44. Optionality
Automated rerouting is source-supported but not universally required.
## 45. Rerouting Trigger
Exact incident types that trigger rerouting are not defined.
Open Decision.
## 46. Rerouting Owner
Route optimization belongs to Logistics/routing systems.
Incident Reporting provides the exception signal.
## 47. Mapbox
`app.md` selects:
```text
Mapbox Matrix and Optimization
```
for Logistics/Rider optimal routing.
If automated rerouting is implemented, the routing subsystem may use the existing Mapbox integration.
## 48. No Direct Mapbox Requirement
Incident creation itself does not need to call Mapbox.
## 49. Reassignment
Whether an Incident causes:
```text
new Courier assignment
```
is not defined.
Open Decision.
# Support-Team Alerts
## 50. Source Capability
An Incident can:
```text
alert support teams
```
## 51. Support Recipient
Exact support roles/queues are not defined.
Open Decision.
## 52. Logistics First
The strongest source requirement remains:
```text
immediately notify central dispatch
```
## 53. Escalation
Additional support escalation may depend on:
```text
incident type
severity
duration
```
but these rules are not defined.
# Severity
## 54. Source Boundary
No severity enum is defined.
## 55. Recommended Future Model
Possible:
```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```
but do not require this for MVP unless selected.
## 56. Accident Severity
Accident reporting may need high-priority treatment, but exact severity mapping is Open.
# Location Context
## 57. Source Boundary
Incident Reporting does not explicitly require GPS coordinates.
## 58. Existing Rider Context
Deliver Order may have current or last known location.
Incident Reporting may optionally attach:
```text
current / last known GPS
```
if available.
## 59. GPS Requirement
Do not make GPS mandatory unless project policy requires it.
## 60. Location Failure
If GPS is unavailable:
```text
Incident report may still be created
```
unless future policy says otherwise.
# Attachments / Evidence
## 61. Source Boundary
`Courier.md` Incident Reporting does not explicitly require:
```text
photos
videos
documents
```
## 62. MVP
Text/category reporting is sufficient from the source.
## 63. Future Evidence
Incident media may be useful later, but this is an Open Decision.
## 64. e-POD Boundary
Delivery evidence belongs to Proof of Delivery.
Incident evidence, if added, is distinct.
Routine final-mile failed delivery attempts (for example, the Buyer is not home) use the assigned task's retryable failed-attempt record. They do not create an incident or change custody by themselves. Safety events and vehicle breakdowns remain separate incident reports.
# Chat Integration
## 65. Operational Communication
After reporting an Incident:
```text
Courier ↔ Logistics Chat
```
may be used for follow-up coordination.
## 66. Chat Is Not Incident
A message such as:
```text
"My vehicle broke down"
```
does not automatically create an Incident record.
## 67. Incident Shortcut
Chat may provide:
```text
Report Incident
```
handoff where useful.
# SOS Boundary
## 68. Accident vs Emergency
Incident Reporting can record:
```text
accident
```
but SOS/Emergency Button is a separate high-priority safety feature.
## 69. Emergency Escalation
For immediate personal safety threats:
```text
SOS
```
should remain available.
## 70. No SOS Replacement
Do not require the Courier to complete a detailed Incident form before sending SOS.
## 71. Linked Records
Whether SOS later creates/links an Incident automatically is Open.
# Delivery-State Boundary
## 72. Incident Does Not Complete Delivery
Never:
```text
Incident created
→ DELIVERED
```
## 73. Incident Does Not Automatically Cancel
The source does not say:
```text
Incident
→ CANCELLED
```
Do not invent automatic cancellation.
## 74. Incident Does Not Roll Back Pickup
Do not automatically change:
```text
IN_TRANSIT → ACCEPTED
```
because an Incident was created.
## 75. Operational State
The active delivery remains subject to Logistics resolution/rerouting policy.
# Complete Delivery Boundary
## 76. Open Incident
Whether an unresolved Incident blocks:
```text
Complete Delivery
```
is not defined.
Open Decision.
## 77. Successful Delivery After Incident
A Courier may potentially resolve the blocker and continue delivery.
The source does not prohibit this.
## 78. History
Completed delivery history may retain a reference that an Incident occurred.
Exact display is Open.
# API
## 79. Create Incident
Conceptual:
```http
POST /api/courier/delivery-tasks/{taskId}/incidents
```
Possible body:
```json
{
  "type": "VEHICLE_BREAKDOWN",
  "description": "..."
}
```
Exact enum/body is Open.
## 80. List Active Task Incidents
Conceptual:
```http
GET /api/courier/delivery-tasks/{taskId}/incidents
```
## 81. Incident Detail
Conceptual:
```http
GET /api/courier/incidents/{incidentId}
```
## 82. Courier Update
Whether Courier may edit:
```text
description
status
```
after submission is not defined.
Open Decision.
## 83. Logistics Resolution APIs
Belong to Logistics-side feature(s), not this Courier spec.
# Backend Authority
## 84. Courier Identity
Backend derives Courier from Bearer token.
## 85. Delivery Task
Backend validates the active task belongs to that Courier.
## 86. Incident Type
Backend validates the selected type against the configured incident taxonomy.
## 87. Status
Client cannot self-assign privileged states such as:
```text
RESOLVED
APPROVED
DISMISSED
```
unless policy explicitly permits it.
## 88. SLA Effect
Backend/domain services determine SLA pause/exception behavior.
# Authorization and Security
## 89. Bearer Authentication
All Courier Incident endpoints require valid authentication.
## 90. Exact Role
Backend verifies:
```text
role = COURIER
```
## 91. Own Task
Courier may report an Incident only for an authorized active task.
## 92. IDOR
Knowing:
```text
task_id
incident_id
order_id
```
must not expose or modify another Courier's Incident.
## 93. Logistics Access
Authorized Logistics personnel should be able to receive/view Incidents for their organization.
Exact permission model belongs to Logistics.
## 94. Sensitive Details
Incident descriptions may contain:
```text
location
accident details
access issues
```
Protect them as operational data.
# Data Integrity
## 95. Stable Link
Incident must remain tied to the correct:
```text
delivery task
Courier
```
## 96. Server Timestamp
Store authoritative:
```text
reported_at
```
## 97. Duplicate Reports
Repeated taps/network retries should not create uncontrolled duplicate Incidents.
## 98. Idempotency
A client request ID/idempotency key is recommended.
## 99. Same Event Repeated
Whether Courier may deliberately report multiple Incidents for one task is allowed by the source but exact rules are Open.
# Error Handling
## 100. Unauthorized Task
```text
deny
→ no Incident
```
## 101. Inactive Task
If task is no longer incident-eligible:
```text
reject
→ show authoritative state
```
## 102. Invalid Type
```text
reject
→ no Incident
```
## 103. Missing Required Description
If description is configured as required:
```text
validation error
```
## 104. Network Failure
Do not claim Incident submitted until server confirms it.
## 105. Notification Failure
```text
Incident stored
→ dispatch notification fails
→ retain Incident
→ retry/allow Logistics retrieval
```
## 106. Duplicate Submission
Return existing logical Incident or safely deduplicate where idempotency is implemented.
# Offline Mode
## 107. Source Context
`Courier.md` separately defines Offline Mode with local task state and synchronization queues.
## 108. Offline Incident Submission
Incident Reporting does not explicitly define offline support.
Open Decision.
## 109. Recommended MVP
Before Offline Mode integration:
```text
Incident submission requires connectivity
```
## 110. Future Offline Model
If later integrated:
```text
Courier creates local Incident
→ pending sync
→ reconnect
→ backend validates active task
→ Incident created or conflict returned
```
## 111. Urgency Caveat
Because Incidents are meant to:
```text
immediately notify central dispatch
```
an offline queued Incident cannot satisfy the "immediate" server-notification requirement until connectivity returns.
The UI must communicate this clearly.
# UX
## 112. Entry Points
Incident Reporting should be accessible from active delivery screens such as:
```text
Pick Up Order
Deliver Order
```
where relevant.
## 113. Recommended Form
```text
Report Incident
├── Incident Type
├── Description
├── Optional contextual data
└── Submit
```
## 114. Source-Backed Type Choices
At minimum:
```text
Vehicle Breakdown
Accident
Inaccessible Delivery Address
```
## 115. Confirmation
After successful server creation:
```text
Incident reported.
Logistics has been notified.
```
Only show that Logistics was notified when the system has at least durably queued/created the dispatch notification event.
## 116. Pending Dispatch Alert
If Incident is stored but realtime alert delivery is delayed:
```text
Incident reported.
Dispatch notification pending/retrying.
```
if the UI exposes that distinction.
## 117. Duplicate Tap
Disable repeated submit while request is in progress.
## 118. Incident Status
If exposed, show:
```text
Open
Acknowledged
Resolved
```
or configured statuses textually.
Exact statuses are Open.
## 119. Accessibility
The React UI should:
- provide clear labels
- use large touch targets
- expose incident status textually
- not rely on color alone
- announce submission success/failure
- keep SOS separately accessible
# Notifications / Dispatch UI
## 120. Dispatch Alert
Incident creation should surface prominently in Logistics operations.
## 121. Recommended Alert Content
```text
Courier
Delivery reference
Incident type
Reported time
Short description
```
## 122. Active Task Link
Dispatch should be able to open the related active task.
## 123. Alert Priority
Exact priority/severity mapping is Open.
## 124. Realtime Transport
Could use:
```text
WebSocket
SSE
polling
internal queue/event
```
No hosted provider is source-required.
# Rerouting Integration
## 125. Trigger Event
Recommended:
```text
Incident created
→ routing/dispatch subsystem receives Incident event
```
## 126. Automated Reroute
Only if configured:
```text
eligible Incident
→ automated rerouting logic
```
## 127. Manual Dispatch
Otherwise:
```text
Incident
→ Logistics dispatch reviews
→ manually reroutes/reassigns/supports
```
## 128. Mapbox Boundary
Mapbox may calculate alternative route solutions.
LUBOSMART decides:
```text
whether reroute is needed
which Courier/task changes
whether reassignment occurs
```
# Audit / History
## 129. Incident History
Preserve enough information to answer:
```text
what happened
which delivery
which Courier
when reported
what status followed
```
## 130. Status Changes
If status changes exist, preserve transition history where practical.
## 131. Resolution Notes
Whether Logistics adds resolution notes is Open.
## 132. Admin Audit Boundary
Do not automatically duplicate every Incident into Admin System Audit Logs unless audit architecture becomes cross-role.
# Performance
## 133. Create Path
Incident creation should be a short transactional path.
## 134. External Work
Do not block Incident creation waiting for:
```text
Mapbox reroute
email
complex support automation
```
## 135. Notification Event
Persist/durably queue the dispatch notification quickly after Incident creation.
## 136. Active Incident Query
Index by:
```text
delivery_task_id
courier_id
status
reported_at
```
as appropriate.
# Third-Party Dependencies
## 137. Core Incident Reporting
No new third-party provider is required.
Core uses:
```text
LUBOSMART backend
Incident record
delivery-task relationship
internal dispatch notification/realtime
```
## 138. Mapbox
Mapbox may be reused if an Incident triggers automated rerouting.
It is not required for Incident creation itself.
## 139. Brevo
Email is not source-required for Incident Reporting.
## 140. SMS / Push
No specific SMS/Push provider is required.
## 141. Emergency Services
Incident Reporting does not require direct local-authority integration.
That concern is closer to SOS, whose own source still prioritizes internal alerting.
# MVP Scope

- Courier may report only against an authorized active task.
## 146. Incident Creation
- Vehicle Breakdown can be reported.
- Accident can be reported.
- Inaccessible Delivery Address can be reported.
- Incident is tied to the active delivery task.
- Incident records the reporting Courier.
- Incident records an authoritative reported time.
- Invalid/unrelated task is rejected.
## 147. Dispatch Notification
- Successful Incident creation creates/durably queues a dispatch notification.
- Logistics can identify the affected delivery.
- Notification failure does not delete the Incident.
- Retry/retrieval allows dispatch to eventually observe the Incident.
## 148. SLA
- Incident provides an event/state that can support SLA pause/exception handling.
- No unsupported fixed pause duration is hardcoded.
- Exact SLA resume rules remain configurable/Open.
## 149. Rerouting
- Incident can be consumed by routing/dispatch logic.
- Automated rerouting is optional/configurable.
- Incident creation does not require Mapbox.
- Mapbox does not own the Incident or delivery state.
## 150. Delivery State
- Incident creation does not set Order `DELIVERED`.
- Incident creation does not automatically cancel the Order.
- Incident creation does not roll back `IN_TRANSIT`.
- Completion behavior with an open Incident follows explicit future policy.
## 151. Security
- Task/Incident IDs cannot bypass authorization.
- Sensitive descriptions are restricted to authorized actors.
- Bearer token is protected.
- Client cannot self-resolve/approve an Incident unless policy permits.
## 152. Third-Party

# Final Definition
## 156. Final Definition
LUBOSMART Incident Reporting is:
```text
the Courier-side
delivery exception reporting workflow
```
for source-backed blockers:
```text
vehicle breakdown
accident
inaccessible delivery address
```
Core source-backed flow:
```text
active delivery task
→ Courier reports blocker
→ Incident record created
→ tied to active delivery task
→ central dispatch notified immediately
→ SLA exception/pause handling
→ optional rerouting or support alert
```
Critical boundary:
```text
Incident Reporting
= record + notify + exception signal

Logistics / support
= resolution and rerouting decisions
```
and:
```text
Incident
≠ automatic cancellation
≠ automatic DELIVERED
≠ automatic reassignment
```
Third-party rule:
```text
No new third-party provider
is required for core Incident Reporting.
```
