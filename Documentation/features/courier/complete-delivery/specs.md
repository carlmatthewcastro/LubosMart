# Complete Delivery

## Final-mile photo and retry revision (2026-09-20)

The Courier's **Delivered** action sends an intent linked to the current photo POD. HTTP 202 is pending Logistics review. Only Logistics can validate that private image and atomically mark the task, Shipment, and Order delivered. A failed doorstep attempt leaves `out_for_delivery` and the assignment intact for a later retry; it does not create a completion intent or a terminal delivery state. The existing reference-based proof contract described below is historical and superseded for final-mile delivery submissions.

## WHAT

- Finalize a final-mile delivery after Courier intent and Logistics-validated proof.
- Courier submits completion intent; Admin dispatch operations validate the evidence and records the authoritative decision.
- The shared fulfillment transition service owns the atomic final state change.
- Final-mile completion is implemented through the shared fulfillment transition service; first-mile pickup still never means Buyer delivery.
- Courier completion and Logistics transition routes are available only after the additive migration has been applied and the authenticated role/affiliation checks pass.
- Preserve one Shipment/Parcel per Order and independent first-mile/final-mile assignments.
- Seller receives the result and never marks an Order delivered.
- Proof of Delivery owns capture, uploads, validation records, and private media delivery.
- Delivery History owns read-only completed final-mile records.
- Exclude returns/refunds, partial fulfillment, payments, payouts, tips, reviews, chat, and incident recovery.
- Exclude automatic completion from GPS, map arrival, QR resolution, or notification delivery.

```text
out_for_delivery
→ Courier submits completion intent and proof reference
→ Admin dispatch operations validate proof and current assignment
→ shared service commits delivered
→ Buyer/Seller notification and Courier history
```

## MUST

### Identity and authority

- Courier requests require Sanctum bearer authentication, courier.active, and policy.consent; `POLICY_CONSENT_REQUIRED` opens acceptance without discarding a valid token.
- Recheck active account, approved affiliation, active LuboSmart dispatch operation, and sole hub.
- Scope each task to the authenticated Courier and its current final-mile assignment.
- Use UUID task references; same-email accounts under another role have no Courier authority.
- Derive organization, hub, Order, Parcel, leg, Courier, and current state server-side.
- Reject client status, reviewer, delivered time, organization, hub, and arbitrary media URLs.
- Logistics validation requires its own active authenticated organization account.
- Admin dispatch operations may validate only tasks belonging to its sole hub and selected-provider context.
- Preserve both the performing Courier and validating/recording Logistics actor.
- No first-mile Courier gains final-mile completion authority merely by collecting the parcel.

### State and proof

- Final-mile task and Shipment must be out_for_delivery before a new completion intent is accepted.
- Proof must belong to the same task, Parcel, Order, and assigned Courier.
- Required proof must be durably stored and validated by Logistics before finalization.
- Missing, rejected, or inaccessible evidence blocks finalization. Pending evidence may be validated inside Logistics finalization; pending proof does not block Courier intent submission.
- Mandatory proof type/combination remains owned by the Proof of Delivery policy.
- Photo POD is required for final-mile delivery; additional signature, OTP, or recipient QR methods need a later policy.
- A configured proof policy must exist before enabling completion.
- Courier submits an opaque evidence UUID, never storage credentials or raw blob paths.
- Submit photo POD first, retain HTTP 202 `proof_id`, then submit completion with that UUID as `evidence_id`, current task revision, `confirmed: true`, and a distinct UUID Idempotency-Key. Do not wait for `completion_eligible: true` or prior Logistics validation.
- Logistics finalization requires the same proof's Courier intent and validates pending proof atomically with delivery. It is not a separate pre-intent proof-approval workflow.
- Use delivered for the target final-mile task, Shipment, and high-level Order projection.
- Do not introduce a separate completed database value solely for history filtering.
- The UI may label delivered as “Completed.”
- Commit all three projections and one completion event in the same transaction.
- Record delivered_at from the server's successful finalization time in UTC.
- Preserve evidence performance/submission times separately from delivered_at.
- The completed first-mile task remains unchanged.
- Final-mile completion does not reserve, release, or fulfill stock again.
- Do not change payment_status or infer COD payment collection from delivered.
- Post-pickup cancellation, failure recovery, returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment remain deferred.

### Reliability and history

- Use a task/actor/organization/action-scoped Idempotency-Key and request hash.
- Matching retries reuse the same intent and reload its current related state after route-level authorization; the response is not a byte-identical original snapshot.
- A reused key with changed payload returns 409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED.
- Store completion intent separately from physical state.
- Only one successful delivered event may exist per Shipment/final-mile task.
- Lock current assignment, task, Shipment, Order, and proof decision consistently.
- Recheck expected revision and proof eligibility inside the transaction.
- A conflicting reassignment or validation returns 409 without overwriting history.
- After hub pickup, assignment/custody history cannot be rewritten.
- Append all accepted/rejected validation decisions with actor, time, and reason.
- Never delete proof/history when a notification is marked read.
- Preserve original request/event IDs for uncertain-response recovery.
- Do not call routing, email, push, or object-storage networks while holding completion locks.

### Notifications and consumers

- Persist durable delivery-notification work with the completion transaction.
- Derive Buyer and Seller recipients from the Order and Shop.
- Deliver through the existing notification infrastructure after commit.
- Deduplicate each recipient/type by the completion event identity.
- Provider failure leaves delivered unchanged and retries communication separately.
- A rollback cannot emit a normal delivered notification.
- Dashboard refetch removes a completed final-mile task from active work.
- Delivery History reads the committed final-mile delivered event.
- Earnings, settlement, tipping, reviews, and metrics require separate approved consumers.
- Do not calculate or invent financial entitlements in this feature.

### React and privacy

- Production UI belongs in the external React repository.
- Store bearer tokens in OS secure storage and send Authorization: Bearer.
- Use JSON model keys exactly as specified by the implemented API revision.
- Load safe Order/task references, delivery state, proof status, and capability reasons.
- Show recipient/destination details only when returned by the authorized active-task contract.
- Never expose registration documents, payment secrets, private reviewer notes, or raw paths.
- Show “Awaiting Logistics validation” for accepted intent that is not finalized.
- A successful submission acknowledgment must not show “Delivered.”
- Disable duplicate taps during a request; retain its idempotency key after timeout.
- Refetch completion status after an uncertain result before starting another action.
- Do not optimistically remove a task before server-confirmed delivered state.
- Offline completion queues are deferred; connectivity is required for submission.
- Camera, signature, and file permissions belong to Proof of Delivery.
- Completion itself adds no GPS permission, geofence, map package, or external provider.
- Show loading, proof-required, pending-review, delivered, denied, conflict, retry, and offline states.
- Use accessible labels, screen-reader status announcements, adequate touch targets, and text statuses.
- On logout, account switch, or authorization loss, clear private in-memory completion data.
- HTTP responses use Cache-Control: private, no-store.

## HOW

### Implemented endpoints
- The development-only Courier API mockup may submit completion intent after proof submission and show the GET projection while Logistics validation is pending.

| Method and path                                  | Actor            | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| GET /api/v1/courier/tasks/{task}/completion      | Assigned Courier | Read eligibility, intent, proof, and committed result |
| POST /api/v1/courier/tasks/{task}/completion     | Assigned Courier | Submit explicit completion intent                     |
| POST /api/v1/logistics/update-status/transitions | Owning Logistics | Validate photo POD and atomically finalize delivery    |

- The Logistics route is owned by Update Status; this spec does not create a second validation endpoint.
- Courier POST uses application/json plus a UUID Idempotency-Key header.
- Request fields: expected_revision (integer at least 1), evidence_id (UUID), confirmed (must be true).
- Reject unknown authority fields and unrelated evidence references.
- GET has no body and no client-controlled ownership parameters.
- New intent and matching replay return 202. Replay may reflect updated intent/task state but still returns `delivered_at: null`; use GET for the authoritative completion projection and timestamp.
- Finalization is visible through a fresh GET, not inferred from an earlier 202.
- Initial GET may return `intent_id: null`, `completion_status: null`, `evidence_id: null`, and `delivered_at: null`; no intent is a valid state, not a parsing error.

```json
{"expected_revision":4,"evidence_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001","confirmed":true}
```

```json
{"data":{"task_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002","intent_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000003","task_status":"out_for_delivery","order_status":"out_for_delivery","evidence_status":"awaiting_validation","completion_status":"awaiting_validation","delivered_at":null,"revision":5}}
```

- completion_status is a response/intent field, not a new OrderStatus.
- An older completion projection must not replace a newly submitted proof ID; compare task/proof identity and refetch. An intent for another proof does not satisfy the selected proof's handoff.
- Courier `expected_revision` is the task revision. Logistics uses the Shipment revision from its own fresh lookup, never the Courier task revision.
- The Laravel controller returns a `data` envelope for GET and POST. React's direct-DTO/empty-202 fallback is defensive compatibility, not a new server guarantee; recover with GET and never fabricate an accepted intent.
- After finalization GET returns delivered task/order states, `completion_status: validated`, and `delivered_at`; the task/Shipment/Order `delivered` state is authoritative.
- The implementation must document its concrete throttling limit before release; no client relies on an invented limit.

### Proposed errors

| HTTP | Code                      | Client action                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 401  | UNAUTHENTICATED           | Restore authentication                             |
| 403  | COURIER_ACCESS_DENIED     | Clear protected state and show account restriction |
| 404  | TASK_NOT_FOUND            | Stop exposing the task                             |
| 409  | COMPLETION_STATE_CONFLICT | Refetch current projection                         |
| 409  | IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED    | Retain original request; fix conflicting input     |
| 409  | PROOF_NOT_VALIDATED       | Show pending/required proof state                  |
| 422  | VALIDATION_FAILED         | Show field errors                                  |
| 429  | TOO_MANY_REQUESTS         | Respect Retry-After                                |
| 503  | FULFILLMENT_UNAVAILABLE   | Show unavailable; no local completion              |

- Error envelopes use message, code, and optional field-addressable errors.
- A missing route or unapplied migration is unavailable, not an empty completion response.
- Network timeout does not prove either transaction failure or success.

### Implementation and verification gate

- These records and routes exist through the additive fulfillment migration; deploy that migration before client integration rather than recreating the schema.
- Follow the first-mile migration bridge in Documentation/schema.md; do not replay historical fulfillment.
- Use the shared transition service; controllers and React never directly assign status.
- Keep unavailable routes disabled until migrations and schema-health checks pass.
- Test MySQL schema, foreign keys, uniqueness, and append-only constraints.
- Test IDOR, role/status/affiliation denial, wrong leg, and unrelated evidence.
- Test pending/rejected proof, premature completion, and duplicate intent.
- Test concurrent Logistics decisions and stale assignments without double completion.
- Test rollback atomicity across task, Shipment, Order, event, and notification work.
- Test that final delivery leaves inventory and payment fields unchanged.
- Test legacy pickup bridge records do not create false final-mile history.
- Test notification failures and retries independently from completion state.
- React tests cover pending 202 versus delivered 200, nullable fields, timeout retry, and secure-storage failures.
- Record the actual backend commit and executed test results before updating copied React contracts.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Only the eligible final-mile Courier submits completion intent.
- [x] Logistics validation and required photo POD gate delivered.
- [x] Task, Shipment, Order, history, and notification work commit atomically.
- [x] Retries/concurrency cannot duplicate delivery or Inventory effects.
- [ ] Verify external React distinguishes pending evidence from confirmed delivery; this repository cannot certify its screens.
- [x] Private DTOs and history remain scoped and immutable.
- [ ] Complete MySQL release verification and external React contract tests; recorded MySQL coverage alone does not satisfy this gate.

### Deferred extensions

- Proof method combinations remain governed by the owning evidence policy.
- Incident recovery, post-delivery chat, earnings, review/tipping, and external carrier callbacks are deferred.
- No offline mutation, global realtime/push transport, or automatic evidence retention deletion is enabled here.
