# Accept Delivery Requests

## Offer price revision (2026-09-21)

An authorized final-mile task and batch projection includes `parcel.price` (the Order merchandise subtotal) and `parcel.currency`, alongside item count and destination area. The Courier can see the parcel's merchandise price before acceptance without receiving payment credentials, address details beyond the offer's safe area, or an identifier entry requirement. The development mockup labels this value **Parcel price**. The assigned task remains the server-side parcel identity for later handoff and POD.

## Final-mile dispatch batch revision (2026-09-20)

One Logistics dispatch schedule is the Courier's final-mile offer. The Courier reviews its parcel count and destination areas, then accepts the entire schedule with one explicit action; partial acceptance is invalid. Each existing Delivery Task and Order remains separate for custody and delivery history. The API must lock and recheck every member, its current offer, Courier affiliation, hub, and state before committing all acceptances together. Rejected individual offers and re-offers are recovery for legacy or exceptional tasks, not the normal batch acceptance path. First-mile and linehaul workflows are unchanged.

Implemented Courier routes are `GET /api/v1/courier/final-mile-batches`, `GET /api/v1/courier/final-mile-batches/{schedule}`, and `POST /api/v1/courier/final-mile-batches/{schedule}/accept`. All derive the Courier and current approved affiliation from the Sanctum token. Acceptance is all-or-nothing and an identical retry returns the already accepted batch. The per-task offer/accept/reject routes documented below remain for exceptional recovery; the normal Courier mockup uses the batch action. The earlier one-task-per-offer wording below describes the underlying task records, not separate normal acceptance taps.

The development-only `resources/js/courier` may exercise the implemented final-mile offer list, detail, acceptance, and rejection routes with bearer authentication. It must use the same server projection and must not treat an accepted offer as hub custody.

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Let a Courier review a Logistics-offered task and explicitly accept responsibility for one Order/Parcel leg.
- **Actor:** The Courier uses the external React application. This repository provides Laravel API endpoints only; no Courier web UI is built here.
- **Current implementation:** `GET /api/v1/courier/first-mile-tasks` and `POST /api/v1/courier/first-mile-tasks/{task}/accept` remain available for first-mile tasks. Final-mile task listing/detail, accept, reject, and Logistics re-offer are implemented on the shared Shipment/DeliveryTask records; physical pickup and delivery remain separate evidence/transition actions.
- **Flow:** Seller confirms `ready_for_pickup` → Logistics assigns first-mile work → Courier explicitly accepts → Pick Up Order. Explicit rejection/re-offer is implemented for final-mile offers only.
- **Task boundary:** One deployed Delivery Task represents exactly one Order/Parcel for one leg. First-mile and final-mile assignments are independent; first-mile completion never grants the final-mile task.
- **Non-goals:** Logistics assignment authority, vehicle/zone CRUD, route optimization, QR scanning, physical pickup, hub processing, delivery, proof of delivery, returns, refunds, earnings, and chat.

## MUST

### Authentication and ownership

- Require `auth:sanctum` and `courier.active`; React sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Resolve the Courier from the bearer token. Never accept `courier_id`, role, organization, hub, task status, or assignment as client authority.
- The account must be active, affiliated with the selected LuboSmart dispatch operation, and associated with its sole operational hub.
- A same-email Buyer, Seller, Logistics, or another Courier account cannot inherit access. Unknown or foreign task IDs fail closed.
- The task and its Order/Parcel must belong to the authenticated Courier's authorized LuboSmart dispatch operation/hub at commit time.

### Assignment and state authority

- Admin dispatch operations create and offers/assigns the task. Courier acceptance confirms responsibility; it does not create a task or grant assignment authority.
- Acceptance is required before physical handoff. An offer/assignment is not `seller_pickup_accepted`, `picked_up_from_seller`, `delivery_accepted`, or `picked_up_from_hub`.
- Legacy first-mile API states are `assigned` → `accepted` → `picked_up_from_seller` (plus `cancelled`); shared physical vocabulary such as `seller_pickup_accepted` must not replace these wire values in React models.
- Final-mile states are a separate leg: `delivery_assigned` → `delivery_accepted` → `picked_up_from_hub` → transit and delivery states.
- Generic Order `assigned` and `picked_up` values are broad projections, not acceptance actions. This feature must not write them directly.
- The shared transition service is authoritative for state, actor, timestamp, task revision, and append-only history.

### Review data and privacy

- Before acceptance, return the task leg, safe pickup context, destination area, package/item summary, schedule, and server-provided approximate `distance_km` when available.
- After acceptance, the owning task contract may reveal the exact street address and operational contact details required for pickup; do not expose more than necessary.
- An authorized task projection may include provider-neutral `distance_km` and `estimated_duration_minutes`. They are advisory, server-calculated, and may be absent or explicitly unavailable.
- Route metrics never decide eligibility, ownership, acceptance, or status. No specific routing vendor is required by this feature.
- Exclude payment credentials, private registration/POD evidence, raw storage paths, unrestricted GPS history, and unrelated Buyer/Seller data.
- Package dimensions, vehicle compatibility, zone, capacity, and online availability are read from their owning Logistics features; do not duplicate their rules here.

### Rejection, re-offer, and staleness

- A deliberate Courier rejection records task-level `rejected`, the authenticated Courier, safe reason, and server time; it leaves the Order unchanged.
- Admin dispatch operations may re-offer the same task to another eligible Courier. Re-offer preserves the prior offer/rejection history and cannot create another Order, waybill, or merged task.
- A rejection is not an Order-level `rejected` transition and does not release inventory by itself.
- An unfinished offer may be displayed as informationally `stale`; staleness does not automatically cancel or reassign it in the MVP.
- A Courier may not accept a task after it has been rejected, withdrawn, reassigned, or otherwise made unavailable; the API returns the current safe projection.

### Accept action and reliability

- Opening, scrolling, resolving, or viewing a task never accepts it. React must require an explicit confirmation action.
- At commit, revalidate task availability, Courier affiliation/status, sole-hub scope, current revision, and any hard eligibility supplied by owning features.
- Accept under a transaction with row locking or an equivalent compare-and-update guard. The authenticated Courier is the only actor recorded.
- Retrying an already successful accept returns the same accepted projection. A changed request or stale revision returns a conflict and never overwrites history.
- Notification, push, or communication failure after acceptance or rejection does not roll back the committed task decision.
- Offline acceptance is not allowed in the MVP; cached task data is reference-only and requires online revalidation.

### Final-mile rejection contract

- `POST /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}/reject` is implemented. It requires an approved Courier offer, a reason, and an idempotency key; the rejected offer remains in history and the same task may be re-offered by Logistics.
- Send JSON `{ "reason": "Cannot take this task" }` (3–1,000 characters) and a UUID `Idempotency-Key`; unknown fields are rejected. `200 data` contains `task_id`, `status: rejected`, and current `offer` with `responded_at`/`rejection_reason`; it does not expose a full history array or next-action hint.

## HOW

### Endpoint contract

- **Implemented** `GET /api/v1/courier/first-mile-tasks` — `auth:sanctum,courier.active`; optional `pickup_schedule_id` UUID and `per_page` 1–50; returns only the authenticated Courier's assigned/accepted first-mile tasks, ordered by `created_at,id`.
- Its response contains `data[]` task ID, machine `status`, Order/waybill references, safe pickup details, destination area, and UTC schedule; `meta` contains `current_page`, `last_page`, and `total`. It is private Courier data and must not be shared-cached.
- **Implemented** `POST /api/v1/courier/first-mile-tasks/{task}/accept` — same auth and server-derived scope; no client `courier_id` or status field; an empty JSON body is accepted; the response returns the committed task projection.
- Accept is idempotent for the same Courier and returns `409` when the task is no longer acceptable. `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, `429`, timeout, and server errors map to explicit React states; a failed request never implies success.
- `GET /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks`, `GET /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}`, and `POST /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}/accept` are implemented for active final-mile work. Admin dispatch operations own `GET .../deploy-rider/tasks/{task}/candidates` and `POST .../offers`; those routes append offers for the same final-mile task.

### Response and error details

- First-mile listing uses `data` and pagination `meta`; final-mile listing returns only `{ "data": [...] }`, currently without pagination/cursor metadata. Do not reuse the first-mile parser for both.
- A task projection contains only opaque `id`, machine `status`, `order.reference`, `waybill.reference`, pickup summary, destination area, and UTC schedule fields authorized for the Courier.
- `GET` accepts no client ownership fields. Invalid `pickup_schedule_id` or `per_page` values return `422` field errors; the server still derives the Courier and organization.
- First-mile accept uses its legacy projection; final-mile accept returns `data.task_id`, `leg: final_mile`, `status: delivery_accepted`, `revision`, current `offer`, Order/Parcel/waybill and area summaries. Nullable pickup timestamps do not establish custody; accept needs no idempotency header and permits an empty JSON body.
- `401` means signed out; `403` means wrong role, inactive account, revoked affiliation, or foreign organization; `404` hides an unknown task; `409` means stale/unavailable state.
- `422` means malformed input or an invalid task action; `429` includes retry guidance; timeout/5xx are retryable reads or uncertain mutations and must be reconciled with a fresh GET.
- Responses are private and use `Cache-Control: private, no-store` for task data; React must clear cached projections after logout or authorization loss.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "task-uuid",
      "status": "assigned",
      "order": { "id": "order-uuid", "reference": "ORD-123" },
      "waybill": { "reference": "WB-123" },
      "destination_area": {
        "city_municipality": "Example",
        "province": "Example"
      },
      "schedule": {
        "starts_at": "server-time",
        "ends_at": "server-time",
        "timezone": "UTC"
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": { "current_page": 1, "last_page": 1, "total": 1 }
}
```

### Review and action states

- The review screen must show the task leg, pickup origin, destination area, package/item summary, schedule, and advisory distance/ETA when supplied.
- Before acceptance, exact street address and contact details remain hidden unless the owning task contract authorizes them; after acceptance, reveal only operationally necessary values.
- The primary action is an explicit **Accept delivery** confirmation. Opening, scrolling, or resolving a waybill never accepts a task.
- Show rejection only for an eligible final-mile offer using the implemented reject endpoint. First-mile has no equivalent route; do not display a working first-mile rejection control.
- On rejection, show `rejected`, reason, time, and “Admin dispatch operations may offer this task again”; do not show the Order as rejected or cancelled.
- A re-offered task returns as a new offer event for the same task ID. Preserve prior rejection history and display the current offer only when the server authorizes it.
- An informational `stale` badge shows last server time and offers refresh; it never starts an automatic reassignment timer.

### Assignment and eligibility details

- Admin dispatch operations own candidate selection and task offering. Courier acceptance only confirms responsibility for the offered leg.
- Revalidate active account, approved affiliation, sole-hub relationship, task revision, and task leg at the accept/reject commit.
- Vehicle, zone, capacity, availability, and GPS freshness rules belong to their owning Logistics contracts. Missing advisory metrics are not an eligibility failure unless that owner says so.
- First-mile acceptance leads to Pick Up Order; final-mile acceptance is a separate endpoint and task leg after hub dispatch.
- A Courier may not accept two conflicting offers if the approved active-task limit is reached; return an authoritative conflict rather than silently dropping one.

### History, notifications, and retention

- Persist accepted/rejected/re-offered decisions as append-only task events with task, leg, Courier, LuboSmart dispatch operation, revision, reason, and server timestamp.
- The Order, waybill, and inventory reservation are unchanged by acceptance or task rejection; physical pickup is recorded only by the later shared transition.
- Queue assignment and decision notifications after commit. Delivery failure cannot undo acceptance, rejection, or re-offer and must be retried separately.
- Do not duplicate every acceptance event into an unrelated Admin audit ledger unless a shared audit contract is approved.
- Retain task/offer history according to the future Logistics operational retention policy; do not invent expiration or automatic reassignment.

### React contract tests

- Parse nullable destination, route, and availability fields without converting missing values into zero or a false status.
- Verify secure-token loading, logout invalidation, `401`/`403` mapping, `409` refresh, `422` field errors, throttling, timeout, and offline recovery.
- Verify explicit acceptance confirmation, disabled duplicate taps, success navigation to Pick Up Order, and stale/rejected/re-offer copy.
- Verify task IDs and machine statuses are preserved across pagination and refresh; never synthesize identity from labels.
- Verify screen-reader labels, focus order, large touch targets, text alternatives to route/map context, and non-color-only status feedback.

### Handoff and rollout

- The available-task card may deep-link to this feature with only the opaque task ID; the server reloads the authoritative projection before accepting.
- After a successful accept, refresh Dashboard and remove the task from the available list; the next action is Pick Up Order, not transit.
- After a rejected offer, return to the Dashboard or wait for a server re-offer; do not locally create a replacement task.
- Keep the current first-mile accept endpoint available while the additive final-mile task/history migration is rolled out; final-mile reject/re-offer calls require that migration and the authenticated Courier/Logistics scopes.
- The React copy must record the inspected commit from this frontmatter and `backend_contract_version: courier-first-and-final-mile-accept-v1`; verify separate first-/final-mile fixtures against the deployed API.
- Push or realtime delivery is only a refresh hint; the API response remains authoritative.

### Backend implementation boundary

- Current models persist legacy first-mile assignment/acceptance plus shared Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask offer, rejection, evidence, and physical-transition records for final-mile work. Advanced expiry, availability, and location policies remain deferred.
- Use one shared assignment/transition service for tenant checks, revision locking, idempotency, actor history, and task-level exception states. Do not create a second state machine in React.
- Logistics remains the creator and re-offerer; Pick Up Order owns QR/evidence submission and Admin dispatch operations validate/records physical pickup.
- Implemented final-mile acceptance uses the same Courier authorization rules but a separate task leg and endpoint; protected task routes also enforce `policy.consent`.

### React handoff

- Store the token only in OS secure storage and clear task snapshots on logout, denial, suspension, or invalid affiliation.
- Map `401` to signed out, `403` to blocked/invalid affiliation, `404` to unavailable task, `409` to refresh/current state, `422` to validation, `429` to retry-after, and timeout/offline to retryable connectivity.
- Screen states include checking session, loading, review, confirm, accepted, rejected, re-offer available, stale, unavailable, conflict, offline, and retryable failure.
- Show machine states as human labels and retain the task leg. Do not infer physical pickup, final-mile assignment, or Order status locally.
- Use accessible text, semantic labels, large touch targets, and non-color-only acceptance/rejection feedback. Route text remains usable without a map.

### Tests, observability, and rollout

- Test role/status/affiliation/sole-hub isolation, IDOR, safe pre/post-acceptance fields, task-leg separation, eligibility revalidation, stale revisions, duplicate accepts, rejection/re-offer history, and notification failure.
- Test React parsing, secure-token failure, loading/empty/stale/forbidden/offline/conflict states, disabled duplicate taps, and accessibility semantics.
- Log correlation ID, task, Courier, LuboSmart dispatch operation/hub, leg, decision, revision, and timestamp; never log bearer tokens, private evidence, raw paths, or unrestricted GPS.
- Keep only advanced expiry/availability policies unavailable. The deployed final-mile accept/reject/re-offer contract uses the shared transition service; record its API revision separately from the legacy `courier-first-mile-accept-v1` contract in React progress.

### Open decisions

- Approve the bounded rejection reason vocabulary and whether a short note is retained.
- Confirm hard versus advisory availability, vehicle, zone, and capacity checks at acceptance.
- Confirm long-term task/offer-history retention; no automatic expiration or reassignment is assumed.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Authenticated Courier can list and explicitly accept its own assigned first-mile task through the implemented API.
- [x] Acceptance is separate from physical pickup and does not directly write custody or generic Order status.
- [x] Courier can reject a final-mile offer with preserved reason/time and Logistics can re-offer the same task without changing the Order.
- [x] Verify stale-offer presentation in the external React app; no automatic cancellation or reassignment is authorized.
- [x] Add final-mile advisory distance/ETA under its owning route contract; existing first-mile schedule metrics do not make final-mile routing available.
- [x] Concurrent/retried final-mile accepts, rejects, and re-offers cannot duplicate assignments or overwrite append-only history.
