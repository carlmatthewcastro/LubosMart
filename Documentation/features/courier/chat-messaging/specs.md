# Courier / Rider Chat / Messaging Specification
## 1. Purpose
Courier Chat / Messaging is LUBOSMART's direct operational communication feature for active delivery work.
`Courier.md` defines:
```text
Core Value:
Communicate with the users.
```
Expanded definition:
```text
A direct communication line.

It enables the courier
to contact the buyer
(or seller/logistics team)

for:
- address clarifications
- gate codes
- immediate delivery delays.
```
System context:
```text
Requires temporary,
secure chat instances
or masked calling features

linked to active orders

to facilitate communication
while protecting
user phone numbers/privacy.
```
This feature therefore provides temporary order-linked communication between the Courier and operational counterparties while protecting direct personal contact details.
A separate `flow.md` is required because the feature has meaningful lifecycle behavior:
```text
active order
→ authorize participants
→ open/create temporary thread
→ exchange messages
→ preserve conversation state
→ restrict/close access according to order lifecycle
```
## 2. Primary Actor
Primary actor:
```text
COURIER / RIDER
```
The Courier uses the React mobile application.
## 3. Counterparties
Source-supported counterparties are:
```text
BUYER
SELLER
LOGISTICS
```
The Courier may communicate with the relevant party for an active order.
## 4. Authentication
Courier mobile authentication follows `app.md`:
```text
React login
→ Laravel personal access token
→ OS secure storage

Requests:
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Every messaging request must resolve:
```text
authenticated user_id
+
COURIER role
```
## 5. Identity Rule
LUBOSMART account uniqueness is:
```text
unique(email, role)
```
Therefore message authorization must use stable user IDs and roles.
Never authorize a participant based on email alone.
# Feature Responsibility
## 6. Chat / Messaging Owns
Courier Chat owns:
- temporary secure order-linked conversations
- Courier-to-Buyer communication
- Courier-to-Seller communication
- Courier-to-Logistics communication
- message creation
- message retrieval
- participant authorization
- thread/order relationship
- read/unread state where implemented
- conversation history during the permitted lifecycle
- real-time or near-real-time message delivery
- privacy protection around phone numbers
- safe conversation access from active delivery screens
- optional masked-calling handoff if later implemented
## 7. Chat / Messaging Does Not Own
It does not own:
- order-state mutation
- delivery-task assignment
- changing Courier availability
- Buyer Address Book editing
- Seller pickup-address editing
- Route optimization
- Proof of Delivery
- Incident creation
- SOS alerts
- Complete Delivery
- refund/dispute resolution
- sanctions
- general social messaging unrelated to orders
## 8. Core Boundary
Chat is:
```text
communication
```
not:
```text
delivery-state authority
```
A message does not itself change:
```text
ACCEPTED
IN_TRANSIT
DELIVERED
COMPLETED
```
# Active-Order Scope
## 9. Source Requirement
The source explicitly says chat/calling is:
```text
linked to active orders
```
## 10. Order Relationship
Every Courier operational conversation should be tied to an:
```text
order_id
```
and/or:
```text
delivery_task_id
```
according to final data architecture.
## 11. No Generic Social Inbox Requirement
The source does not require unrestricted Courier messaging with arbitrary LUBOSMART users.
MVP should focus on:
```text
active delivery/order communication
```
## 12. Active Order Meaning
The exact states that count as:
```text
active
```
are not defined.
Open Decision.
## 13. Recommended Active Context
Likely relevant phases include:
```text
ACCEPTED
IN_TRANSIT
before final completion
```
where the Courier needs operational coordination.
This is a recommendation.
## 14. Post-Completion Access
Whether messages remain:
```text
readable
sendable
archived
closed immediately
```
after `DELIVERED` / `COMPLETED` is Open.
# Communication Purposes
## 15. Address Clarifications
Source-supported purpose:
```text
address clarifications
```
Example operational need:
```text
which entrance
which building
which unit context
```
where appropriate.
## 16. Gate Codes
Source-supported purpose:
```text
gate codes
```
Gate/access information should be treated as sensitive operational content.
## 17. Immediate Delivery Delays
Source-supported purpose:
```text
report immediate delivery delays
```
This can be communicated to:
```text
Buyer
Seller
Logistics
```
as appropriate.
## 18. Routing Assistance
Courier may contact Logistics for operational routing/support where relevant.
## 19. Pickup Coordination
Courier may contact Seller/Logistics for pickup clarification.
## 20. No Address Mutation
A Buyer message saying:
```text
deliver somewhere else
```
must not automatically overwrite the authoritative delivery address.
Any address-change policy belongs to another workflow.
# Thread Model
## 21. Temporary Secure Thread
The source explicitly describes:
```text
temporary secure chat instances
```
## 22. Recommended Thread Boundary
Recommended:
```text
Order
├── Courier ↔ Buyer
├── Courier ↔ Seller
└── Courier ↔ Logistics
```
This avoids unnecessary cross-party disclosure.
## 23. Group Chat
The source does not require:
```text
Buyer + Seller + Logistics + Courier
```
in one shared room.
Open Decision.
## 24. Separate Threads Recommendation
Separate counterparty threads are recommended for privacy and operational clarity.
## 25. Thread Identity
Each conversation should have a stable:
```text
thread_id
```
or equivalent identifier.
## 26. Order Link
Thread must be linked to its active:
```text
order_id
```
or delivery-task context.
## 27. Participants
Thread participants should be derived from authoritative order/delivery relationships.
The client must not freely add arbitrary users.
# Participant Authorization
## 28. Courier Authorization
The Courier may access only threads for orders/tasks they are currently authorized to work on, subject to post-completion history policy.
## 29. Buyer Authorization
Buyer access should be limited to the Buyer's own relevant order.
## 30. Seller Authorization
Seller access should be limited to the Seller/shop relevant to the order/pickup context.
## 31. Logistics Authorization
Logistics access should be limited to the LuboSmart dispatch operation handling the active delivery.
## 32. Cross-Order Isolation
Knowing a:
```text
thread_id
order_id
message_id
```
must not expose another order's conversation.
## 33. Same-Email Isolation
Same email under a different role does not grant participant access.
# Message Model
## 34. Message Entity
Conceptually:
```text
message_id
thread_id
sender_user_id
sender_role
body
created_at
```
Exact schema is Open.
## 35. Sender Authority
The backend derives sender identity from authentication.
The client must not authoritatively submit:
```text
sender_user_id
sender_role
```
## 36. Message Body
Plain text is sufficient for MVP.
## 37. Message Length
Maximum message length is not defined.
Open Decision.
## 38. Empty Messages
Empty/whitespace-only messages should be rejected.
## 39. Ordering
Messages should be ordered using authoritative:
```text
created_at
sequence
```
or equivalent.
## 40. Immutable Sender
A message's sender identity must not be editable by the client.
# Read / Unread State
## 41. Requirement Level
Read/unread state is not explicitly defined in `Courier.md`.
It is recommended for a usable messaging experience.
## 42. Recommended Participant State
Possible per-participant fields:
```text
last_read_message_id
last_read_at
unread_count
```
Exact approach is Open.
## 43. Delivery Receipts
Separate:
```text
sent
delivered
read
```
receipts are not source-required.
Open Decision.
# Realtime Behavior
## 44. Messaging Freshness
Operational messaging should be real-time or near-real-time.
## 45. Transport Options
LUBOSMART may use:
```text
WebSockets
Server-Sent Events
polling
```
or another internal transport.
## 46. No Hosted Realtime Requirement
The source does not require a hosted messaging/realtime vendor.
## 47. Server Authority
Realtime events notify clients of changes.
The database/backend remains authoritative for message history.
## 48. Reconnect
After reconnect:
```text
refetch missing messages
→ reconcile with local UI
```
## 49. Duplicate Events
Realtime retries must not create duplicate message rows.
Stable `message_id` should be used for deduplication.
# Sending a Message
## 50. Preconditions
Before sending:
```text
authenticated participant
+
authorized active order/thread
+
valid message body
```
## 51. Send Operation
Conceptually:
```text
compose
→ submit
→ authorize
→ persist
→ publish realtime event
→ return durable message
```
## 52. Persistence Before Publish
Recommended:
```text
persist message first
→ then publish realtime event
```
## 53. Failed Persistence
If persistence fails:
```text
do not display message as permanently sent
```
## 54. Network Failure
The mobile app should distinguish:
```text
pending
failed
sent
```
if optimistic UI is used.
Exact client behavior is Open.
## 55. Duplicate Send
Retries should be idempotent or deduplicated where feasible.
# Receiving Messages
## 56. Active Screen
New messages should appear without requiring a full app restart.
## 57. Background App
Background mobile notification behavior is not explicitly defined.
Open Decision.
## 58. Push Provider
No Push provider is selected by the source for this feature.
Do not make mobile Push mandatory.
## 59. In-App Notification
At minimum, when the app is active, new-message indicators should be supported.
# Masked Calling
## 60. Source Capability
`Courier.md` explicitly permits:
```text
masked calling features
```
## 61. Purpose
Masked calling should:
```text
facilitate communication
while protecting user phone numbers/privacy
```
## 62. Core MVP Choice
Recommended MVP:
```text
secure order-linked chat
```
as the required core communication implementation.
## 63. Masked Calling Optionality
Masked calling is source-supported but should remain optional until LUBOSMART selects:
- telephony provider
- number masking mechanism
- call routing
- billing
- call retention/logging policy
## 64. No Direct Phone Exposure
If masked calling is implemented, the Courier should not receive the counterparty's raw personal phone number merely to initiate the call.
## 65. Telephony Provider
No provider is selected in `app.md` or `Courier.md`.
Open Decision.
## 66. No Invented Twilio Requirement
Do not require:
```text
Twilio
```
or another telephony vendor without explicit architecture selection.
# Privacy
## 67. Source Requirement
The source explicitly emphasizes:
```text
protecting user phone numbers/privacy
```
## 68. Phone Number Minimization
Core chat should not need to reveal direct phone numbers.
## 69. Participant Identity
Use operational display names/roles where appropriate.
## 70. Sensitive Message Content
Users may share:
```text
gate codes
delivery instructions
location clarification
```
Treat conversation access as operationally sensitive.
## 71. Retention
Message retention duration is not defined.
Open Decision.
## 72. Deletion
Whether participants may delete messages is not defined.
Recommended MVP:
```text
no destructive deletion
```
for operational traceability.
This is a recommendation.
## 73. Edit Messages
Message editing is not source-required.
Open Decision.
# Attachments
## 74. Source Boundary
`Courier.md` Chat/Messaging does not require:
```text
photos
files
voice notes
location pins
```
## 75. MVP
Plain text is sufficient for MVP.
## 76. Proof Photos
Delivery-evidence photos belong to:
```text
Proof of Delivery
```
not Chat attachments.
## 77. Incident Media
Incident evidence belongs to:
```text
Incident Reporting
```
if implemented.
# Order State Boundary
## 78. Message Does Not Mutate Order
Never:
```text
Courier says "delivered"
→ Order = DELIVERED
```
## 79. Message Does Not Confirm Pickup
Never:
```text
Seller says "picked up"
→ IN_TRANSIT
```
## 80. Owning Features
State mutations remain with:
```text
Accept Delivery Requests
Pick Up Order
Complete Delivery
Logistics Update Status
```
# Deliver Order Integration
## 81. Active Transit
Deliver Order should provide a direct Chat/Messaging entry point.
## 82. Address Clarification
During transit:
```text
Deliver Order
→ Chat Buyer
→ clarification
→ return to route
```
## 83. Delay Reporting
Courier can use Chat to notify Buyer or Logistics of immediate delays.
## 84. No Route Mutation
Chat does not directly recalculate or persist route changes.
# Pick Up Order Integration
## 85. Seller Contact
At Seller pickup:
```text
Pick Up Order
→ Chat Seller
```
may be used for pickup clarification.
## 86. Logistics Contact
Courier may contact Logistics for sorting-center/hub issues.
# Incident Reporting Boundary
## 87. Operational Delay vs Incident
A normal short delay may be communicated through Chat.
A material blocker such as:
```text
vehicle breakdown
accident
inaccessible address
```
belongs to Incident Reporting.
## 88. Chat Does Not Replace Incident
Sending a message to Logistics does not automatically create an `Incident` record.
## 89. Incident Link
A Chat thread may link to Incident Reporting for active task context.
# SOS Boundary
## 90. Emergency
SOS/Emergency Button owns high-priority emergency alerting.
## 91. Chat Not Emergency Replacement
Do not require the Courier to type a chat message during an emergency instead of using SOS.
# Post-Completion Behavior
## 92. Temporary Nature
The source explicitly calls chat instances:
```text
temporary
```
## 93. Sendability After Completion
Recommended:
```text
Order active
→ send + read

Order completed
→ read-only/archive
```
possibly after a short configured window.
Exact behavior is Open.
## 94. History
Whether completed-order conversations remain visible to the Courier is Open.
## 95. Dispute Support
Retaining read-only history may help support/dispute workflows.
This is a recommendation.
# API
## 96. Thread List
Conceptual:
```http
GET /api/courier/chat/threads
```
MVP may restrict this to relevant active-order threads.
## 97. Order Threads
Conceptual:
```http
GET /api/courier/orders/{orderId}/chat
```
or:
```http
GET /api/courier/delivery-tasks/{taskId}/chat
```
## 98. Messages
Conceptual:
```http
GET /api/courier/chat/threads/{threadId}/messages
```
with cursor pagination.
## 99. Send Message
Conceptual:
```http
POST /api/courier/chat/threads/{threadId}/messages
```
Example:
```json
{
  "body": "I am at the gate. Which entrance should I use?"
}
```
## 100. Read State
If implemented:
```http
POST /api/courier/chat/threads/{threadId}/read
```
## 101. Start Thread
Whether threads are:
```text
pre-created
or
lazy-created on first contact
```
is Open.
## 102. Counterparty Selection
If separate threads are used, the API may require a permitted counterparty role.
The backend determines the actual participant from the order relationship.
# Authorization
## 103. Bearer Authentication
Every Courier messaging endpoint requires a valid Bearer token.
## 104. Exact Role
Backend verifies:
```text
role = COURIER
```
## 105. Order Access
Courier must be authorized for the linked active order/task.
## 106. Thread Access
Courier must be a valid participant in the thread.
## 107. Message Access
Message belongs to an authorized thread.
## 108. IDOR
Knowing IDs does not bypass participant/order authorization.
# Security
## 109. XSS / Rendering
Message bodies are untrusted user content.
Render safely.
## 110. Rich HTML
MVP should not accept arbitrary HTML.
## 111. URLs
If URLs become clickable, validate/sanitize presentation.
## 112. Rate Limiting
Messaging endpoints should have reasonable abuse/rate protection.
Exact limits are Open.
## 113. Spam / Abuse
Moderation/reporting behavior is not defined.
Open Decision.
## 114. Credentials
Never expose:
```text
Bearer token
password
API secret
```
inside thread metadata.
# Pagination
## 115. Message History
Messages must be cursor/bounded paginated.
## 116. Initial Load
Load a recent window, not the entire thread.
## 117. Older Messages
Allow loading older messages incrementally where retained.
## 118. Ordering
Use stable chronological sequencing.
# Offline Behavior
## 119. Offline Mode Boundary
`Courier.md` separately defines Offline Mode.
## 120. Message Sending Offline
Offline Chat sending is not source-required.
Open Decision.
## 121. Recommended MVP
Recommended:
```text
no network
→ message not server-confirmed
→ show failed/pending state
```
## 122. Cached Messages
Recent thread history may be cached later, but authoritative sync belongs to Offline Mode/client architecture.
# Notifications
## 123. In-App Unread
Recommended:
```text
new message
→ unread indicator
```
## 124. Background Notification
Push notification for background messages is Open.
## 125. Brevo
Brevo email is not required for operational Courier Chat.
## 126. SMS
SMS is not required.
## 127. Calling
Masked calling, if implemented, uses separate telephony infrastructure.
# Data Model
## 128. Conceptual Thread
```text
chat_threads
- id
- order_id / delivery_task_id
- conversation_type
- active/archived state
- created_at
```
Exact schema is Open.
## 129. Conceptual Participants
```text
chat_participants
- thread_id
- user_id
- role
- last_read...
```
## 130. Conceptual Messages
```text
chat_messages
- id
- thread_id
- sender_user_id
- body
- created_at
```
## 131. Conversation Type
If separate counterparty threads are adopted:
```text
COURIER_BUYER
COURIER_SELLER
COURIER_LOGISTICS
```
Exact enum names are Open.
# Performance
## 132. Message Query
Index by:
```text
thread_id
created_at / sequence
```
## 133. Thread Query
Index active-order/thread participant relationships.
## 134. No N+1
Avoid repeated participant/order lookups per message row.
## 135. Realtime Payload
Publish compact events:
```text
thread_id
message_id
sender
created_at
```
with safe preview fields where needed.
# Reliability
## 136. Durable Message Before Ack
A successful send response should mean the message is durably stored.
## 137. Publish Failure
If DB persist succeeds but realtime publish fails:
```text
message remains stored
→ recipient gets it on refetch/reconnect
```
## 138. Duplicate Client Retry
Client-generated idempotency key may be used.
Open Decision.
## 139. Reconnect Recovery
Clients must fetch missed messages after reconnection.
# UX
## 140. Recommended Active-Order Entry
```text
Active Delivery
├── Message Buyer
├── Message Seller
└── Message Logistics
```
show only contextually valid counterparties.
## 141. Thread Screen
```text
Chat
├── Counterparty Role/Name
├── Order Reference
├── Message History
└── Composer
```
## 142. Order Context
Keep order/task reference visible enough to prevent messaging in the wrong delivery context.
## 143. Privacy
Do not display raw phone numbers in secure chat.
## 144. Empty Thread
Example:
```text
No messages yet.
```
## 145. Send Failure
Show:
```text
Message failed to send.
Retry.
```
## 146. Archived Thread
If post-completion send is disabled:
```text
Delivery completed.
This conversation is read-only.
```
## 147. Accessibility
The React UI should:
- expose sender and message text to screen readers
- identify unread state textually
- use accessible composer/send controls
- use large touch targets
- announce send failures
- not rely on color alone
# Masked Calling UX
## 148. Optional Call Action
If later implemented:
```text
Call Buyer
Call Seller
Call Logistics
```
may appear only for authorized active-order context.
## 149. Privacy Label
The UI should make clear that direct phone numbers are protected.
## 150. Failure
If masked call cannot be created:
```text
fallback to secure chat
```
where possible.
# Third-Party Dependencies
## 151. Core Chat
No new third-party provider is required for core secure text chat.
LUBOSMART can use:
```text
backend database
authenticated APIs
self-hosted WebSockets/SSE
or polling
```
## 152. Masked Calling
Masked calling likely requires telephony infrastructure/provider.
No provider is selected in the source.
## 153. Brevo
Not required.
## 154. Mapbox
Not required for messaging itself.
## 155. SMS
Not required for core Chat.

- Same-email other-role account does not inherit Courier thread access.
- Courier sees only authorized order-linked threads.
## 160. Thread Scope
- Each core thread is linked to an active order/task.
- Arbitrary users cannot be added by the mobile client.
- Cross-order thread IDs do not leak messages.
- Buyer/Seller/Logistics participant access is backend-derived.
## 161. Messaging

- Chat does not edit Buyer Address Book.
- Chat does not create an Incident automatically.
- Chat does not replace SOS.
## 164. Lifecycle
- Active-order conversation is sendable according to policy.
- Post-completion behavior follows configured archive/closure rule.
- Historical messages are read-only if archived.
- Thread expiration/deletion does not silently erase required operational records.
## 165. Third-Party

# Final Definition
## 169. Final Definition
LUBOSMART Courier Chat / Messaging is:
```text
a temporary,
secure,
active-order communication channel
```
that allows the Courier to contact:
```text
Buyer
Seller
Logistics
```
for source-backed operational needs such as:
```text
address clarification
gate codes
immediate delivery delays
```
Core privacy rule:
```text
communication must protect
participant phone numbers/privacy
```
Recommended MVP:
```text
secure order-linked text chat
```
with optional future:
```text
masked calling
```
Critical boundary:
```text
Chat
= communication

Accept / Pick Up / Complete / Incident / SOS
= stateful operational actions
```
Third-party rule:
```text
Core text chat requires no new hosted provider.

Masked calling may require
a future telephony provider,
but none is selected by current sources.
```
