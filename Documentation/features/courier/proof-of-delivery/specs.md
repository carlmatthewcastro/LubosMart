# Proof of Delivery (e-POD)

## Courier capture revision (2026-09-21)

The Courier's final-mile delivery action is photo POD: **Open camera for POD** invokes rear-camera capture where supported, the Courier submits the selected photo, and **Delivered** sends the linked completion intent to Logistics for review. The browser mockup may use the device file chooser when camera capture is unavailable. The UI does not ask for or display a parcel identifier as a proof step. The hub handoff has also moved to task-bound confirmation without identifier entry; see Pick Up Order. The authorized photo and intent remain pending until Admin dispatch operations validate them.

## Final-mile photo revision (2026-09-20)

The final-mile drop-off method is a private photo POD tied to the assigned task, replacing tracking ID, Order reference, and waybill QR as delivery proof. Hub pickup evidence remains a separate custody step. The Courier submits one JPEG, PNG, or WebP photo strictly under 10 MiB with `expected_revision` and a UUID `Idempotency-Key`, receives a pending `proof_id`, and then explicitly taps **Delivered** to submit intent. Logistics retrieves `GET /api/v1/logistics/delivery-proofs/{proof}/photo` under its organization/hub scope and validates the matching proof and intent before the task, Shipment, and Order become `delivered`. Admin dispatch operations may reject a bad photo through `POST /api/v1/logistics/delivery-proofs/{proof}/reject` with a reason and current task revision; rejection also rejects its pending intent while leaving custody unchanged. The Courier can privately reread its own photo at `GET /api/v1/courier/delivery-proofs/{proof}/photo`. Failed drop-off attempts record a reason and time without changing custody or cancelling the assignment; the Courier may retry the next day with a new photo. A failed attempt after a photo invalidates that photo for completion; the next attempt needs fresh POD. Apply `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md` to validation, storage, and private access. The older JSON identifier contract described below is historical and no longer accepted by the delivery-proof endpoint.

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Capture evidence that an authorized Courier handed the parcel to the Buyer or placed it at the approved destination.
- **Actor boundary:** Courier captures and submits evidence in the external React app. Admin dispatch operations validate and records the authoritative evidence event; Complete Delivery owns the final `delivered` transition.
- **Current implementation:** `shipment_evidence` stores separate QR/reference hub-pickup evidence and private photo POD for final-mile delivery. Courier photo submission and Delivered intent remain pending until Logistics confirms; signature capture is deferred.
- **Flow:** accepted final-mile task → Courier reaches destination → capture approved proof → submit to Logistics → Admin dispatch operations validate/records → Complete Delivery checks proof → `delivered`.
- **Task boundary:** Evidence belongs to exactly one authorized Delivery Task and its Order/Parcel. First-mile handoff evidence is handled by Pick Up Order; final-mile proof is handled here.
- **Non-goals:** task assignment/acceptance, navigation, pickup, returns/refunds, partial fulfillment, dispute decisions, payment, Courier web UI, or direct Order-status editing.

## MUST

### Authentication and ownership

- Require `auth:sanctum`, `courier.active`, and `policy.consent`; React sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Resolve the Courier, task, Order/Parcel, LuboSmart dispatch operation, and sole hub server-side. Never trust client `courier_id`, owner IDs, target status, or storage path.
- The Courier must have an accepted final-mile task and the task must be in the approved delivery/drop-off state.
- Evidence may be created only for that task's Order/Parcel and the authenticated Courier's current Logistics affiliation.
- Cross-role, cross-organization, foreign task, guessed proof ID, or inactive-account access fails closed without existence disclosure.

### Admin Dispatch Operations validation and recording authority

- Courier captures a private photo POD for final-mile delivery. Signature or other methods require a later approved proof policy; QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference are not delivery proof.
- Courier submits the evidence to the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation; the client does not mark proof `verified`, change custody, or set `delivered`.
- Admin dispatch operations validate task/Order/Parcel linkage, final-mile leg, current state, Courier authorization, evidence type, required fields, storage confirmation, and idempotency.
- Logistics records the authoritative evidence event with the performing Courier, recording authorized Admin dispatch account, server timestamp, task/Order references, and safe evidence metadata.
- `waybill_access_events` and QR resolves remain access audits. A scan/access event alone never satisfies e-POD or advances custody.
- Evidence status is separate from delivery state: `awaiting_validation`, `validated`, `rejected`, or `unavailable`; submission time is `submitted_at`, not a new persisted `submitted` status.
- Complete Delivery may finalize only when the server reports that the configured proof requirement is durably satisfied.

### Evidence methods and upload policy

- The implemented delivery method at `out_for_delivery` is one private photo POD. QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference evidence remains available only for the separate hub-pickup handoff; signature and proof combinations are deferred.
- If an image is enabled, inherit `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`: JPEG/JPG, PNG, or WebP, strictly under 10 MiB, detected MIME/signature/decode validation, generated object key, and private authorized delivery.
- Store bytes in the configured private filesystem/object-storage abstraction (Azure-compatible in this project); store only generated path and required metadata in the database.
- Never expose raw disk/blob paths, cloud credentials, bearer tokens, or public predictable evidence URLs.
- Do not require AI image recognition, face recognition, OCR, geofencing, or a hosted provider without a separate approved policy.
- A copied waybill QR cannot satisfy delivery POD; it remains separate from the authorized hub-pickup evidence flow.

### Data minimization and privacy

- Evidence is linked to one task, Order/Parcel, Courier, and LuboSmart dispatch operation; no cross-order reuse is allowed.
- Capture only the minimum image/signature/QR data needed to prove handoff. Avoid unrelated people, rooms, documents, or private information in photos.
- Buyer/Seller access, Logistics support access, and retention are policy-controlled; default evidence visibility is private and authorized.
- React may show proof progress and safe state but never raw storage paths or unrestricted evidence lists.
- Evidence DTOs exclude payment credentials, registration documents, reviewer notes, unrelated PII, and unrestricted Courier location history.

### Lifecycle and completion boundary

- Capture and upload do not themselves set `delivered`; Complete Delivery invokes a server-side proof check.
- A failed or rejected proof leaves delivery state unchanged and gives the Courier a safe retry or corrected-capture action.
- Once valid proof is recorded, it is append-only; ordinary Courier actions cannot overwrite it after completion.
- A Logistics manual recovery must use the same transition service and preserve the original Courier event; it cannot fabricate proof or bypass required evidence.
- Failed doorstep attempts are recorded without changing custody. Terminal delivery failure, returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment remain deferred and are not inferred from a failed upload.

### Reliability and offline boundary

- Use an idempotency key and expected task revision for submission. Matching retries return the same evidence projection; changed payloads or stale state return `409`.
- Confirm object storage before evidence becomes `validated`; reconcile orphaned objects and failed database writes without claiming proof success.
- Offline capture is not authoritative in the MVP. A future encrypted local queue must replay through Logistics validation and may be rejected as stale.
- Communication, notification, or route-provider failure after Logistics records evidence cannot roll back the committed event.
- Camera/storage denial, invalid QR, corrupt image, timeout, throttling, and server errors remain explicit recoverable states.

## HOW

### Implemented photo endpoint contract
- The development-only Courier API mockup submits a private photo POD and shows its pending Logistics validation state. Signature controls remain unavailable.

- `POST /api/v1/courier/tasks/{task}/proof-of-delivery` — accepts multipart `photo` and `expected_revision` plus a UUID `Idempotency-Key`. It creates awaiting-validation private evidence and never sets `delivered`. JSON identifier payloads return `422`.
- `GET /api/v1/courier/tasks/{task}/proof-of-delivery` — deferred; use the task/completion projections while a dedicated proof-read contract is finalized.
- Photo submission is implemented under `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`; signature submission remains deferred.
- The client must not submit `courier_id`, organization/hub IDs, target status, `verified`, `delivered`, raw storage paths, or another task's Order ID as authority.
- HTTP 202 returns `data.task_id`, `proof_id`, `evidence_status`, `custody_state`, `completion_eligible: false`, and `submitted_at`. Map this `proof_id` to completion's `evidence_id`; unlike hub pickup, the response names it `proof_id`.
- After that response, enable the separate explicit completion-intent action while proof is `awaiting_validation`. Waiting for Logistics to approve proof first creates a circular dependency: Logistics needs an intent for that same proof before finalization.
- Errors distinguish `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, `429`, timeout, offline, storage, and notification failure. Identical retries are safe; uncertain responses require a fresh GET.
- All responses are private and `Cache-Control: private, no-store`; signed/capability media delivery, if approved, is short-lived and authorization-checked.

### Submission details

- Multipart accepts only `photo` (JPEG, PNG, or WebP strictly under 10 MiB) and `expected_revision` (integer at least 1); a UUID `Idempotency-Key` is required in the header.
- The task ID, Order/Parcel link, Courier identity, LuboSmart dispatch operation, and current delivery state are derived server-side.
- Multipart image fields use the shared upload policy; filenames, extensions, and browser MIME values are hints only and never authorization.
- A signature is submitted as a bounded vector or image representation only when the policy and endpoint permit it; it is linked to this task and cannot be reused.
- A waybill QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference is not accepted as final-mile delivery POD. The hub-pickup identifier remains a separate custody event.
- `expected_revision` belongs in multipart form data and the UUID belongs in the `Idempotency-Key` header, not an `idempotency_key` form field. Retain the exact attempt across uncertain retries.
- A new submission returns `awaiting_validation`; matching retries reuse the evidence record with refreshed related state. Neither photo upload nor HTTP 202 alone means delivered.

```text
POST multipart/form-data
photo=<JPEG, PNG, or WebP file>
expected_revision=4
Idempotency-Key: <UUID header>
```

### Evidence lifecycle and access

- `submitted_at` records submission time; `awaiting_validation` identifies pending review; `validated` means accepted evidence; `rejected` means refused; `unavailable` is not successful proof.
- Admin dispatch operations may reject an evidence submission with a safe reason; the Courier can correct and resubmit without overwriting the rejected history.
- A validated record contains immutable task/Order/Parcel, Courier, Logistics recorder, method, server time, and storage metadata.
- Complete Delivery uses the proof UUID as `evidence_id`, current task revision, explicit confirmation, and its own API validation; the proof response's `completion_eligible` is currently always false, not a live eligibility query.
- Buyer, Seller, Logistics, and Admin read permissions are separate policy decisions; private-by-default remains the fallback.
- Any media delivery uses an authorized application stream or short-lived capability URL and `no-store`; raw blob paths never leave the server.
- Evidence correction, deletion, retention, and dispute access append history rather than changing the original event.

### Upload and partial-failure rules

- Validate size, detected MIME, signature, image decode, and resource limits before permanent storage; reject malformed or spoofed files with `422`.
- Store media in the configured private disk/object store and persist only generated object metadata. Never embed cloud credentials in React.
- Do not mark evidence `validated` until storage confirmation and the Logistics recording transaction both commit.
- If storage succeeds but the database write fails, quarantine/clean up the orphan and return a retryable failure; never report proof success.
- If the database commits but notification delivery fails, evidence remains committed and notification retries separately.
- Client previews, local signatures, and upload progress are provisional until the server response confirms the evidence state.

### Error and retry mapping

- `401` signs the Courier out; `403` means inactive/unauthorized task or affiliation; `404` hides foreign task/proof existence.
- `409` means stale task revision, duplicate/conflicting evidence, or completion race; refresh the task before retrying.
- `422` returns field-addressable proof/file errors; `429` supplies retry-after; timeout/offline keeps the attempt uncertain until a fresh GET.
- Camera or signature permission denial is recoverable and never satisfies proof. Scanner mismatch remains a rejected evidence attempt.
- React must disable duplicate taps while pending, reuse the idempotency key after a timeout, and never create a second proof locally.

### React proof screen

- Show task/Order reference, destination context, required methods, evidence status, upload progress, and the next server-authorized action.
- Use explicit **Add photo POD** and **Delivered** actions. Signature and delivery QR actions remain unavailable until separately approved.
- Announce validation/rejection reasons textually, provide retake/correct-and-resubmit actions, and keep controls keyboard/screen-reader accessible.
- Clear private previews and cached evidence on logout, account denial, affiliation revocation, or task removal.
- The app must work with text status and no map; route/navigation belongs to Deliver Order.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "task_id": "task-uuid",
    "proof_id": "evidence-uuid",
    "evidence_status": "awaiting_validation",
    "custody_state": "out_for_delivery",
    "completion_eligible": false,
    "submitted_at": "server-time"
  }
}
```

### Backend implementation boundary

- The additive fulfillment migration supplies QR evidence, task links, actor/history and revision records. Media storage/upload/delivery remains a separate extension, not a prerequisite for current QR submission.
- Use one transition/evidence service for ownership, proof policy, file validation, storage confirmation, idempotency, and completion checks.
- Logistics Update Status owns validation and authoritative recording; Courier e-POD owns capture/submission; Complete Delivery owns finalization.
- Keep enum-like columns string-backed with PHP enum casts and do not add detailed physical states to `orders.status` without an approved migration.

### React states and UX

- Screen states: task loading, proof requirements, camera/signature permission, capture, preview, upload progress, awaiting Logistics validation, validated, rejected, missing proof, conflict, offline, and retry.
- Show the task/Order reference and destination context needed for the handoff, but never imply proof success from a local preview or completed upload progress bar.
- Explain accepted image types and the 10 MiB limit before selection; use accessible labels, text status, large touch targets, and non-color-only errors.
- Preserve the idempotency key across timeout/retry; clear private evidence previews and cached task data on logout or authorization loss.
- After QR submission, use Complete Delivery's GET/POST contract for intent; evidence may await validation. Only Logistics finalization establishes delivered, not a client-computed eligibility flag.

### Tests, observability, and rollout

- Test role/task/Order/organization isolation, cross-order reuse, invalid photos, upload limits/signatures, storage partial failure, private delivery, duplicate submissions, stale revisions, failed-attempt photo freshness, and actor preservation.
- Test that Logistics records the Courier performer and Logistics recorder, that access/scan does not satisfy proof, and that notification failure cannot undo evidence.
- React tests cover capture permissions, file validation feedback, progress/retry, secure storage, offline/timeout/conflict states, and accessibility.
- Log task/proof/event IDs, performing Courier, recording authorized Admin dispatch account, evidence state, result, revision, and timestamp; never log media bytes, raw paths, or QR tokens.
- Keep media upload endpoints unavailable until the shared file policy and storage contract are deployed. The QR/tracking-ID/Order-reference submission is live with the shared transition service; record its API revision separately from the deferred media extension in React progress.

### Open decisions

- Confirm which proof method(s) are required for each delivery and who may sign or receive the parcel.
- Confirm Logistics/Admin/Buyer/Seller read permissions, retention/deletion, malware scanning, and whether direct-to-object-storage upload is allowed.
- Confirm QR issuer/expiry/replay policy and offline capture/replay behavior.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Courier can submit private photo POD only for its accepted final-mile task and linked Order/Parcel.
- [x] Admin dispatch operations validate and records the implemented evidence with performing Courier and recording authorized Admin dispatch account preserved.
- [x] Evidence status is separate from custody; invalid, duplicate, or access-only events do not advance delivery.
- [x] Photo POD is scoped, privately stored, idempotent, and consumable by Complete Delivery; reference-based delivery proof is retired.
- [x] e-POD never directly sets `delivered`, changes assignment, or decides refunds/returns.
- [ ] Verify external React photo capture/upload, pending validation, rejection, offline, conflict, and retry states; the in-repo mockup is a development harness.
