# Courier Authentication

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Let a Courier select one eligible LuboSmart dispatch operation, submit a pending application, wait for Logistics approval, and obtain mobile API access.
- **Current foundation:** Registration, organization discovery, profile/address/vehicle creation, private evidence persistence, affiliation approval, bearer login, identity, logout, status gating, and a generic password-recovery entry point exist in Laravel.
- **Client boundary:** Courier screens belong to the separate React project. This repository provides API behavior only; do not add a Courier React page, browser-cookie flow, or web dashboard under `resources/js/`.
- **MVP cardinality:** one Courier has one current Logistics affiliation. The selected organization owns exactly one operational hub; the server derives that hub and the client cannot select a sub-hub.
- **Approval authority:** The associated active LuboSmart dispatch operation approves or rejects the Courier affiliation. Admin may suspend, restore, or deactivate an account through the separate lifecycle feature, but Admin does not approve the affiliation.
- **Boundary:** recovery completion, email verification, MFA, affiliation history/revocation, and session-device policy remain deferred. First-mile pickup/routing and final-mile QR evidence, movement, completion, and history APIs exist under their owning specs; signature proof, live location telemetry, earnings, and offline mutations remain deferred; private photo POD and final-mile batch routing are available.

```text
GET active Logistics options
→ select organization; server derives sole hub
→ multipart registration creates pending Courier records
→ Logistics approves or rejects affiliation
→ active account + approved affiliation → bearer login
↘ pending/rejected/suspended/deactivated/invalid affiliation → 403
```

## MUST

### Identity and relationship rules

- Derive `UserRole::Courier`, `UserStatus`, affiliation status, reviewer, hub, and token ability on the server. Prohibit client authority for these fields.
- Normalize email by trimming and lowercasing it before validation and lookup.
- Enforce the shared `unique(email, role)` rule. A same-email Buyer, Seller, Admin, or authorized Admin dispatch account is not a Courier account.
- Require one `CourierLogisticsAffiliation` per Courier in the MVP. Its `logistics_hub_id` must belong to the selected organization and be that organization's sole hub.
- Treat `users.status` and `courier_logistics_affiliations.status` as separate facts. Protected access requires an active Courier, approved affiliation, active Logistics owner, and existing hub.
- Persist enum-like columns as strings and use PHP enum casts; do not add native MySQL enum columns.

### Registration rules

- Accept `first_name`, `last_name`, optional one-character `middle_name`, `contact_number` (maximum 32), `sex`, `birth_date` before today, `email`, and confirmed password.
- Accept `sex` values `male`, `female`, `non_binary`, or `prefer_not_to_say`. Password validation is at least eight characters with mixed case and numbers.
- Accept one `logistics_organization_id` UUID. Re-resolve an active LuboSmart dispatch operation with a hub inside the transaction; ignore any client `hub_id` or sub-hub field.
- Accept nested `address` fields: `address_line_1`, optional `address_line_2`, `barangay`, `city_municipality`, `province`, `region`, and `postal_code` (maximum 10). Set country to `Philippines` server-side.
- Use bundled PSGC Region → Province → City/Municipality → Barangay data and a manual fallback in React. Current Courier registration stores labels/text only; it does not persist PSGC codes, coordinates, or provider IDs.
- Accept `vehicle_type` values `motorcycle`, `car`, or `van`, plus a required `plate_number` (maximum 64). MVP requires exactly one Vehicle per Courier; registration creates one and the additive Vehicle Fleet migration now enforces uniqueness after duplicate preflight.
- Multiple/shared vehicles, maintenance, vehicle history, and capacity values/units/matching are deferred under the Logistics Vehicle Fleet Management spec. This does not remove existing registration/operational history or add a map-pin contract.

### React registration field map

- Text controls submit the exact snake-case keys shown in the API contract; display labels may use normal human-readable wording.
- `middle_name` is optional and limited to one character; an empty value should be omitted or sent as `null`.
- `birth_date` is a date value, not a client-calculated age; show age only after the server resource returns it.
- `logistics_organization_id` is the selected organization UUID; do not derive or submit a hub ID.
- `address[address_line_1]` is the required street/house detail; `address[address_line_2]` is optional.
- `address[barangay]`, `address[city_municipality]`, `address[province]`, and `address[region]` are PSGC/manual labels.
- `address[postal_code]` is required text, preserving leading zeroes where applicable.
- `vehicle_type` is one of `motorcycle`, `car`, or `van`; `plate_number` is required text.
- `government_id` and `vehicle_registration` are separate multipart file parts, not Base64 JSON fields.
- Do not send `age`, `country`, `role`, `status`, `hub_id`, `reviewer_id`, or a client-generated owner identifier.
- Preserve the selected form values after a recoverable `422`, but clear password values before retrying.

### Evidence and transaction rules

- Current multipart fields are `government_id` and `vehicle_registration`; both are required images. Planned registration replaces the combined image with required `official_receipt` and `certificate_of_registration`, plus optional make/model, under the registry contract. These inputs are not live; a distinct `drivers_license` field remains separate work.
- After initial approval, implemented Courier vehicle endpoints permit type/plate/make/model edits and independent OR/CR replacement without reapproval, notifying associated Logistics after commit. Preserve initial approval evidence; keep the combined registration field until a coordinated React registration rollout switches to separate fields, and reject mixed legacy/new forms.
- Apply [`Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`](../../../references/file-upload-requirements.md): JPEG/JPG, PNG, or WebP only, strictly under 10 MiB, with detected MIME/signature/decode validation.
- Store generated private object keys and document metadata. Never return bytes, raw paths, credentials, or predictable URLs in the Courier resource.
- Create User, CourierProfile, address, pending RegistrationApplication, pending affiliation, Vehicle, and Document rows in one logical transaction.
- Delete any stored evidence objects when persistence fails. Registration never issues a token or activates the account.
- A duplicate same-role email returns `EMAIL_ALREADY_REGISTERED` with a field-addressable `email` error; concurrent duplicate handling must be covered before this contract is called complete.

### Admin Dispatch Operations approval and lifecycle

- Logistics lists only pending affiliations belonging to its authenticated organization and decides `approve` or `reject` for one affiliation.
- Rejection requires a safe reason of at most 2,000 characters. Approval clears a rejection reason; both decisions record reviewer and time on the application and affiliation.
- Approval atomically changes the Courier User/Application and affiliation to active/approved; rejection changes them to rejected. A second decision on a non-pending affiliation returns a conflict.
- A pending, rejected, revoked, suspended, deactivated, wrong-role, orphaned, or inactive-Logistics relationship cannot issue a token or read protected Courier data.
- Notification delivery is post-commit and is not a current Courier API guarantee. A provider failure cannot reverse an approval or rejection.

### Token and protected-session rules

- Login requires `email`, `password`, and `device_name`; `role` and `abilities` are prohibited.
- Verify password, Courier role, active account, approved affiliation, active Logistics owner, and valid hub before creating a token.
- Issue only the server-owned `courier` ability and return the plain-text token once. `/me` never returns the token.
- React stores the token only in OS secure storage and sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; it must not log or ordinary-cache tokens.
- `/me` and logout require `auth:sanctum` and `courier.active`. Logout deletes only the current personal access token.
- After active Courier and approved-affiliation checks, protected Courier APIs require current shared Terms of Service and Privacy Policy consent. `/me`, logout, policy status, and policy acceptance remain reachable so React can present the consent flow.

### Stable errors and privacy

- Invalid credentials return `422` with `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`; inactive status returns `403` with `ACCOUNT_PENDING_APPROVAL`, `ACCOUNT_REJECTED`, `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED`, or `ACCOUNT_INACTIVE`.
- Invalid or missing affiliation returns `403` with `LOGISTICS_ASSOCIATION_INVALID`; wrong role returns `FORBIDDEN_ROLE`.
- Missing current shared policy acceptance returns `403 POLICY_CONSENT_REQUIRED` with required policy/version descriptors and read/status/accept paths; React must not treat it as invalid credentials.
- Validation and file failures return `422`; login throttling returns `429` with `Retry-After`. Unknown organization and cross-organization IDs fail closed.
- Auth DTOs may include Courier ID/email/role/status, profile first/last name/age, affiliation status, organization name, and hub name. They omit secrets, evidence, full address, reviewer notes, token hashes, and storage paths.

### Client lifecycle mapping

- Before a request, show `checking_session`, `submitting`, or `authenticating` without treating a local token as proof of approval.
- A successful registration enters `pending_approval`; the response contains no token and cannot open operational screens.
- `ACCOUNT_PENDING_APPROVAL` maps to a pending screen with a retryable status check, not to a login loop.
- `ACCOUNT_REJECTED` maps to a rejection screen; do not invent resubmission or appeal controls.
- `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED`, `ACCOUNT_INACTIVE`, and `LOGISTICS_ASSOCIATION_INVALID` clear operational session state and explain that access is blocked.
- A successful login stores the returned token once, then calls `/me` only to restore identity on later launches.
- The development-only Courier mockup mirrors the React consent lifecycle after login: it checks `/api/v1/policy-consent/status`, fetches the current public Terms/Privacy documents, displays only policies whose current version still requires acceptance, posts explicit acceptance for each exact version, and loads protected Courier data only after the status response confirms completion. A valid bearer token is preserved while consent is pending.
- A `401` clears secure storage and returns to sign-in; a `403` preserves the reason-specific blocked state.
- A timeout or offline error preserves unsent registration form data but never queues login or approval bypass actions.
- A `429` honors `Retry-After`; retries must not submit duplicate registrations or passwords automatically.
- A logout response is terminal for the current token; an already-invalid token may be cleared locally after a confirmed `401`.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Registration creates one pending Courier foundation and no credential.
- [x] Additive uniqueness and approval completeness checks fail closed on ambiguous vehicle cardinality; legacy Logistics review continues to use the combined OR/CR registration evidence until separate registration fields are rolled out.
- [x] Age is derived from `birth_date`; client-supplied age is rejected or ignored.
- [x] Organization and sole hub are server-derived; role/status/reviewer/hub injection is prohibited.
- [x] Accepted image types and the strict under-10-MiB boundary are enforced server-side.
- [x] Logistics-only approval/rejection and protected status gating are implemented.
- [x] Bearer login, `/me`, current-token logout, generic recovery response, and DTO redaction exist.
- [x] Complete recovery delivery/reset and affiliation-history/revocation, and verify concurrent duplicate registration; existing foundation tests do not establish these extensions.
- [x] First- and final-mile API availability is owned by the task/pickup/delivery specs, not blocked by obsolete Auth claims that the operational schema is absent.

## HOW

### Implemented API contract

The inspected backend baseline is commit `d1abeee73d0141e1fd7dda4bea0ee3fead370378`; this documentation review does not certify external React or MySQL release tests.

#### `GET /api/v1/courier/auth/logistics-options` — implemented

- The development-only Courier API mockup may use this public list to populate registration. It must still submit the current legacy combined `vehicle_registration` field until the separate OR/CR registration contract is implemented.

- Public endpoint with `throttle:60,1`; optional query `search` is matched case-insensitively against `business_name`; maximum 50 rows.
- `200`: `{ "data": [{ "id": "uuid", "business_name": "Example Logistics" }] }`. No credentials, hub IDs, or private application data are returned.
- Registration must revalidate organization activity and hub existence; a stale option is not an authorization grant. Network failure is retryable; no cache is authoritative.

#### `POST /api/v1/courier/auth/register` — implemented

- Public `multipart/form-data` endpoint with `throttle:10,1`. Send nested keys such as `address[address_line_1]` and the two named image fields.
- Request fields are the registration rules above. Prohibited fields include `role`, `status`, `hub_id`, and `reviewer_id`; extra authority fields must not be forwarded.
- `201`: `{ "message": "Registration submitted for Logistics approval.", "courier": <safe Courier resource> }`; no token is returned.
- `422`: validation, duplicate Courier email, unavailable selected organization, or invalid file. The React app maps `errors` by field and can retry after correction.

#### `POST /api/v1/courier/auth/login` — implemented

- Public endpoint with an internal five-attempt throttle key based on normalized email and IP. Request: `{ "email", "password", "device_name" }`.
- `200`: `{ "token": "plain-text-once", "courier": <safe Courier resource> }`.
- `422 INVALID_CREDENTIALS` covers unknown/wrong credentials; `403` covers account or affiliation denial; `429` includes `Retry-After`.

#### `GET /api/v1/courier/auth/me` — implemented

- Requires `auth:sanctum` and `courier.active`; no request body. `200`: `{ "courier": <safe Courier resource> }`.
- Middleware rechecks role, status, affiliation, active organization, and hub. React treats `401` as signed out and `403` as a state-specific access screen.

#### `POST /api/v1/courier/auth/logout` — implemented

- Requires the same middleware; empty request body. `200`: `{ "message": "Signed out successfully." }`.
- The server deletes only the current token. React removes its secure token after a successful response or after a confirmed unauthorized response.

#### `POST /api/v1/courier/auth/forgot-password` — recovery entry point only

- The development-only mockup may exercise this entry point, but must present its generic response without promising an actual reset email.

- Public request `{ "email" }`; current controller records a limiter hit and always returns a generic `200` message.
- No reset token or notification is currently created. React must show a generic result and must not promise an email or fabricate a reset route.

#### Admin Dispatch Operations-owned approval routes — implemented, not Courier actions

- `GET /api/v1/logistics/courier-applications` requires `auth:sanctum` + `logistics.active`; it returns pending affiliation IDs and safe Courier name/email rows for that organization.
- `POST /api/v1/logistics/courier-applications/{affiliation}/{decision}` accepts `approve` or `reject`; reject requires `reason` (maximum 2,000). Cross-organization IDs return not-found and non-pending decisions conflict.
- These routes are documented for workflow coordination. The React Courier app must never call them or display Logistics reviewer controls.

### Resource shapes for Dart models

- The registration, login, and `/me` `courier` object has `id`, `email`, `role`, `status`, `profile`, and `logistics` keys.
- `profile` is present when the backend eager-loads it and contains `first_name`, `last_name`, and computed `age`; treat absent nested data as nullable.
- `logistics` is present when the affiliation is loaded and contains `status`, `organization`, and `hub` names; the current resource does not expose organization or hub IDs.
- `role` is the string `courier`; do not infer role from the endpoint path or a local enum alone.
- `status` uses lowercase values such as `pending`, `active`, `rejected`, `suspended`, or `deactivated`.
- Affiliation `status` is separate from account `status`; both must be retained in the client model.
- The options response has a top-level `data` array and each item has only `id` and `business_name`.
- Error responses may contain `code`, `message`, and an optional `errors` object keyed by request field.
- Unknown response fields may be ignored for forward compatibility, but missing required fields are a contract error worth logging safely.
- Do not persist reviewer IDs, evidence metadata, raw paths, password-reset tokens, or API bearer tokens in ordinary app state.

### Data, React handoff, and testing

- Auth uses `users`, `courier_profiles`, `addresses`, `vehicles`, `registration_applications`, `documents`, `courier_logistics_affiliations`, and Sanctum tokens. The additive fulfillment migration also defines operational records; apply it before consuming final-mile APIs.
- React must model nullable `middle_name`, affiliation/rejection states, and missing optional address line; it must not assume a hub ID exists in the Courier DTO.
- Use explicit states: checking session, signed out, registration editing/submitting, pending approval, rejected, active, suspended, deactivated, invalid affiliation, offline, timeout, and retrying.
- Registration upload UI must show accepted formats and the under-10-MiB limit, progress/cancel/retry, and server field errors. Client checks are convenience only.
- Do not reproduce Eloquent, SQL, enum implementation, or authorization logic in Dart. The API response is authoritative and all mutations need online revalidation.
- Add API tests for role/status/affiliation/hub scope, prohibited fields, duplicate races, file spoofing/boundaries, transaction cleanup, token issuance/logout, throttling, DTO privacy, and LuboSmart dispatch operation isolation.
- Add React contract fixtures/tests for JSON parsing, multipart names, secure-storage failure, `401/403/409/422/429`, timeout/offline states, and redacted DTOs. Mocks supplement but do not replace backend verification.
- Before expanding Auth, approve reset delivery, email verification, MFA, resubmission/revocation history, device limits, and any coordinate/pin policy. Update this spec and the copied React contract with the new backend commit/API version.

### Handoff checklist

- The React project copies this spec and records the backend commit or API version used for its fixtures.
- The copied document must retain the exact route, field, status, response, and prohibition wording unless a newer backend contract supersedes it.
- Any unavailable operational route is shown as unavailable in the React project; no mock route is promoted to production behavior.
- React implementation review confirms secure-storage failure, app restart, token expiry, offline, timeout, and retry behavior.
- Backend review confirms that every new Auth mutation remains server-owned, transactional, scoped, and covered by API tests.
- A material contract change increments this spec version, updates the copied React document, and appends `Documentation/PROGRESS.md`.
