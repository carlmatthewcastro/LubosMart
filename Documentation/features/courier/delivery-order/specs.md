# Deliver Order

## Map and parcel-price revision (2026-09-21)

The accepted final-mile batch route must display the Logistics hub as a labelled start marker, every delivery stop with known coordinates as a numbered circle, and a visible line in sequence when at least two coordinates exist. The API uses Geoapify Matrix for stop order and Geoapify Routing for the road `LineString`; the development Courier mockup renders these GeoJSON coordinates over authenticated Geoapify `osm-bright` raster tiles with MapLibre GL JS. A Routing or Matrix failure keeps a labelled straight-line fallback through known stops; missing coordinates are reported as unavailable and never fabricated. The Courier task projection includes `parcel.price` from the Order merchandise subtotal and `parcel.currency`, so the Courier can see the parcel's merchandise price without payment credentials. The Courier screen need not display parcel/waybill/Order identifiers for delivery actions. Older optional-map and route-deferred statements below describe the former baseline.

## Final-mile batch route revision (2026-09-20)

An accepted Courier dispatch schedule offers `GET /api/v1/courier/final-mile-batches/{schedule}/route`. Laravel verifies the current Courier, approved affiliation, destination hub, and every accepted final-mile member. It sends only coordinate pairs to Geoapify Matrix to order at most 15 delivery stops from the hub, then uses Geoapify Routing for road-following geometry. The response provides advisory distance/time, ordered stops, and a GeoJSON `LineString`; the development Courier mockup draws that line over private Geoapify tiles with MapLibre GL JS. If coordinates, quota, or provider data are unavailable, the route says unavailable and the address list remains usable. A road-geometry failure yields a labelled straight stop-sequence line. No linehaul manifest or transfer parcel is included. The older route-deferred wording below records the prior baseline.

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Help an accepted final-mile Courier task travel from the sole Logistics hub to the authoritative Buyer destination.
- **Actor boundary:** Courier views task and route context in React. LuboSmart validates task ownership and state; Admin dispatch operations remain assignment/state authority; Complete Delivery owns finalization.
- **Current implementation:** The API creates a final-mile task when Admin dispatch operations dispatch a Shipment from its sole hub, supports Courier-scoped task listing/detail/accept/reject, QR hub-pickup evidence submission, `in_transit`/`out_for_delivery` movement, and an accepted-task delivery-context read with the immutable destination address/contact and hub context. An accepted dispatch schedule has an advisory Geoapify Matrix/Routing route; live Courier location telemetry remains deferred.
- **Flow:** Admin dispatch operations dispatch → final-mile task is offered → Courier accepts → Courier picks up from hub → `in_transit` → `out_for_delivery` → proof/Complete Delivery.
- **Task boundary:** One Delivery Task represents one Order/Parcel and one leg. First-mile and final-mile assignments are independent and may use the same or a different Courier.
- **Non-goals:** assignment, acceptance, pickup, scan/evidence recording, proof storage, completion, route-provider credentials, returns/refunds, or a production Courier web UI.

## MUST

### Authentication and task scope

- Require `auth:sanctum`, `courier.active`, and `policy.consent`; React sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Derive Courier, accepted final-mile task, Order/Parcel, selected LuboSmart dispatch operation, and sole hub server-side.
- Reject foreign task IDs, inactive accounts, revoked affiliations, reassigned tasks, and guessed `courier_id`/organization/hub fields without tenant disclosure.
- The task must be in `delivery_accepted` or a later server-authorized transit state before delivery context is returned.
- The Buyer checkout destination snapshot is authoritative. Courier cannot edit or replace it in this feature.

### Canonical status and ownership

- Final-mile sequence is `delivery_assigned` → `delivery_accepted` → `picked_up_from_hub` → `in_transit` → `out_for_delivery` → `delivered`.
- `delivery_assigned` is an offer, not acceptance; `picked_up_from_hub` is physical possession and is committed by Pick Up Order after Logistics validation.
- This feature reads transit context and may submit permitted location updates; it must not directly write custody or `OrderStatus`.
- `delivered` is owned by Complete Delivery after Proof of Delivery requirements are satisfied.
- First-mile completion does not grant final-mile assignment. Admin dispatch operations may assign the same or another eligible Courier through a separate task.
- Generic Order `assigned`, `picked_up`, and `in_transit` values are broad projections; use detailed task state from the server response.

### Provider-neutral route, distance, and ETA

- The API may provide `distance_km` and `estimated_duration_minutes` for the authorized task, plus an optional route representation or external-navigation handoff.
- These values are server-calculated, provider-neutral, advisory, timestamped, and may be absent or explicitly unavailable.
- Missing/stale coordinates, routing timeout, quota exhaustion, or provider failure must return an honest unavailable state, never zero distance or a fabricated ETA.
- Route metrics cannot decide assignment, eligibility, custody, delivery completion, or destination authority.
- No map, routing vendor, SDK, API key, or graphical route is required by this feature. A backend adapter may be selected later without changing the Courier contract.
- If a map is rendered in React, it is a presentation layer over the server-authorized destination/route data and must not become a state authority.

### Destination and operational data

- An accepted-task response may include the operational Order, parcel, waybill, pickup hub, destination address, item/package summary, delivery instructions, and contact fields needed for delivery.
- Before final-mile acceptance, Dashboard rules limit data to safe destination area and package summary; exact street/contact disclosure occurs only after acceptance and only when authorized.
- Redact payment credentials, private registration/POD evidence, raw storage paths, unrelated Buyer/Seller data, and unrestricted Courier GPS history.
- Do not transmit names, phone numbers, or street lines to a route provider when coordinates alone suffice.

### Location and tracking

- Location updates are optional operational context and remain scoped to the active task and LuboSmart dispatch operation.
- The server records location timestamps/precision and may mark a location stale; React must not invent freshness or infer arrival from GPS alone.
- Foreground updates may support route refresh. Background tracking, frequency, retention, consent, and Buyer-facing live maps require a separate approved policy.
- GPS loss must not automatically cancel, reassign, complete, or alter the task; show the last safe state and request retry/reconnect.
- Never expose unrestricted historical traces to the Courier, Buyer, Seller, or unrelated LuboSmart dispatch operation.

### Reliability and handoffs

- Route reads are safe to retry. Location mutations, if enabled, require an idempotency key and expected task revision; duplicate retries return the committed projection.
- A stale revision or Logistics reassignment returns `409` with the latest safe state and blocks local delivery actions until refreshed.
- Offline mode may show a bounded encrypted snapshot, but route/location writes and completion require online revalidation in the MVP.
- Communication, route-provider, or notification failure cannot roll back a committed Logistics decision or pickup state.
- Handoff to Proof of Delivery occurs only at the destination; this feature does not accept evidence or mark `delivered`.

## HOW

### Implemented endpoint contract and deferred extensions
- The development-only Courier API mockup may show authorized delivery context and submit the implemented revision-checked movement transitions.

- `GET /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks` — implemented; active final-mile tasks offered to or accepted by the authenticated Courier.
- `GET /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}` — implemented; Courier-scoped task detail, including an unaccepted offer for review.
- `GET /api/v1/courier/tasks/{task}/delivery` — implemented; returns the immutable destination address/contact and pickup-hub context only after the Courier accepts the offer.
- `POST /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}/accept` — implemented; accepts the current Logistics offer.
- `POST /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}/reject` — implemented; records a reason and leaves the task available for Logistics re-offer.
- `POST /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}/pickup` — implemented companion action owned by `Documentation/features/courier/pick-up-order/specs.md`; use its exact request, pending-evidence response, and retry contract. Deliver Order starts movement only after Logistics records `picked_up_from_hub`.
- `POST /api/v1/courier/final-mile-tasks/{task}/status` — implemented; advances only `picked_up_from_hub → in_transit → out_for_delivery`. Send JSON `{ "target_state": "in_transit", "expected_revision": 4 }` and a UUID `Idempotency-Key` header.
- Current `FinalMileStatusRequest` also accepts `status` as an alias for `target_state`, and `revision` for `expected_revision`; canonical fields take precedence when both are supplied. The React handoff's `{status, expected_revision}` is supported. Revision must be at least 1; unknown fields fail `422`.
- Movement returns `200 {data: <task projection>}`; invalid sequence/stale revision gives `409 TASK_STATE_CONFLICT`, reused key with changed payload gives `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`. Retain the same key/payload after timeout and refetch state; this review does not add or change the endpoint.
- `GET /api/v1/courier/tasks/{task}/route` — planned/unavailable; same scope; returns provider-neutral route summary, `distance_km`, `estimated_duration_minutes`, calculation time, freshness, and an optional render/navigation payload.
- `POST /api/v1/courier/tasks/{task}/location` — planned/unavailable; JSON `{ "latitude": number, "longitude": number, "captured_at": timestamp, "expected_revision": number, "idempotency_key": string }`; no client status/owner fields.
- Implemented task DTOs use `task_id`, `leg`, `status`, `revision`, current offer, Order/Parcel/waybill and area summaries; delivery adds authorized destination/hub context. Human labels, route freshness, metrics, and next-action fields are not guaranteed current fields.
- `401` signs out; `403` means inactive/unauthorized task; `404` hides foreign task existence; `409` means stale/reassigned state; `422` means invalid coordinates; `429`, timeout, offline, and provider failure are explicit retryable states.
- Task and location responses are private, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, and never shared across Courier accounts.

### Deferred route payload contract — not a live response

- `distance_km` is a non-negative decimal with an explicit unit; `estimated_duration_minutes` is a non-negative integer or `null` when unavailable.
- `calculated_at` and a freshness state accompany every metric. A stale metric may be displayed as advisory but cannot be treated as a current guarantee.
- `route_status` is one of server-approved values such as `available`, `unavailable`, or `stale`; React must preserve unknown future values as an unavailable presentation.
- Optional route geometry or navigation links are opaque presentation data. They cannot contain credentials, hidden waypoints, unrelated user locations, or authorization claims.
- A route response is scoped to the accepted task and its immutable pickup/destination snapshots. It cannot be requested for a guessed coordinate pair outside that task.
- Repeated route reads are safe and may use short-lived server caching keyed by task/revision and coordinate fingerprints; private data is never shared-cached.

### Deferred location submission contract — do not call

- If location updates are enabled, latitude and longitude are validated for range, precision, timestamp skew, and task scope; client status and destination fields are ignored.
- The server may reject locations that are too old, too frequent, outside the active task window, or associated with a changed revision.
- A successful location response returns the server timestamp, accepted precision, current safe task revision, and any refreshed advisory route metrics.
- Location writes do not mark arrival, pickup, transit, out-for-delivery, or delivery complete. Those transitions belong to the owning features.
- Rate limits and consent must be explicit before background collection. The app must stop sending after logout, task removal, or affiliation loss.

```json
{
  "latitude": 14.5995,
  "longitude": 120.9842,
  "captured_at": "client-time",
  "expected_revision": 4,
  "idempotency_key": "location-attempt-uuid"
}
```

### Error and recovery details

- A route provider timeout returns `route_status: unavailable` or a typed error; it never returns zero distance or a guessed duration.
- A stale location response returns `409` with the latest safe task projection. React must refresh before sending another update.
- A `422` response identifies invalid latitude, longitude, timestamp, or idempotency fields without echoing sensitive coordinates unnecessarily.
- A `429` response includes retry-after; the client must not busy-loop or increase collection frequency after throttling.
- Offline route display may use the last bounded snapshot with a visible timestamp; no offline location write is authoritative.

### React handoff and navigation

- The active screen shows the accepted task, destination, current state, distance/ETA freshness, route availability, and a clear next action.
- A map is optional. Textual address/area, distance, ETA, and external-navigation action must remain usable without map tiles.
- Returning from external navigation triggers a fresh task/route read rather than trusting a background callback.
- Permission denial, GPS disabled, route unavailable, stale metrics, reassignment, and destination reached are distinct accessible states.
- The app never displays a local arrival calculation as a server transition and never enables Complete Delivery solely because a route ended.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "task_id": "task-uuid",
    "status": "in_transit",
    "destination": { "city_municipality": "Example", "province": "Example" },
    "distance_km": 7.4,
    "estimated_duration_minutes": 25,
    "route_status": "available",
    "calculated_at": "server-time"
  }
}
```

### Backend implementation boundary

- The additive fulfillment migration already defines final-mile task, offer, evidence, revision and history records. Live location telemetry remains deferred; final-mile route results use a bounded 24-hour coordinate-fingerprint cache.
- Use one transition/location service for task ownership, state checks, idempotency, rate limits, and append-only event history.
- Deploy Rider owns assignment; Pick Up Order and Logistics Update Status own hub pickup validation/recording; Proof of Delivery and Complete Delivery own drop-off.
- Route adapters must hide provider credentials and normalize results to the provider-neutral fields above. They cannot write task state.
- Store enum-like statuses as strings with PHP enum casts; keep detailed physical milestones out of `orders.status`.

### React states and UX

- States include session check, loading, accepted, route available, route unavailable, stale metrics, GPS permission denied, offline, conflict/reassigned, retry, destination reached, and handoff to proof.
- Show textual distance/ETA with calculation time and an explicit “unavailable” label when missing; never show `0 km` as fallback.
- Allow external navigation only from an authorized task response. Returning from navigation must refetch the task.
- Use accessible map alternatives, semantic labels, large touch targets, and non-color-only route/state indicators.
- Clear private snapshots and location queues on logout, account denial, affiliation revocation, or task removal.

### Tests, observability, and rollout

- Test role/affiliation/sole-hub/task isolation, first-/final-mile independence, destination immutability, route fallback, stale/missing coordinates, provider failure, and privacy.
- Test location validation, idempotency, concurrent reassignment, stale revisions, offline replay rejection, and no direct custody/completion mutation.
- React tests cover parsing nullable metrics, route unavailable/timeout, secure storage, permission denial, offline/refresh races, and accessibility.
- Log task/leg, Courier, organization/hub, metric freshness, provider adapter result, revision, and timestamp without raw GPS history or destination PII.
- Verify destination snapshots cannot be replaced through route or location payloads.
- Verify missing metrics remain `null`/unavailable and never become `0` or a fabricated ETA.
- Verify route cache keys include task scope and revision and cannot leak across organizations.
- Verify communication failure never changes a committed task state.
- Use the implemented final-mile batch route for advisory stop order, distance/time, and road geometry. Keep live Courier location telemetry unavailable until its own contract is implemented; record the newer batch-route contract separately in React progress.
- Roll out task reads before location writes and route rendering; each capability remains explicitly unavailable until its backend contract is live.
- Reconcile a lost response with a GET before allowing another location or navigation action.
- Do not use a client-generated ETA, route, or coordinate to populate an authoritative Order or Delivery Task field.

### Open decisions

- Select the routing adapter and define coordinate precision, freshness threshold, route-cache lifetime, and provider quota fallback.
- Decide whether foreground/background location is collected, its retention, and whether Buyer/Logistics receive live updates.
- Decide whether external navigation links or a React map renderer are required; neither is assumed for the API contract.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Only an accepted final-mile task can return delivery context; location updates remain unavailable until separately implemented.
- [x] Implement final-mile batch route metrics and explicit missing-coordinate/provider fallback independently of first-mile pickup routing. External React route rendering remains unverified.
- [x] Destination comes from the immutable checkout snapshot and cannot be changed by the Courier.
- [x] Route/location capabilities cannot fabricate progress or mutate custody; stale revisions and reassignment are rejected by the implemented task transitions.
- [x] First-mile and final-mile assignments remain independent and `delivered` remains owned by Complete Delivery.
- [ ] Verify external React loading, unavailable, stale, offline, conflict, retry, and accessible fallback states.
