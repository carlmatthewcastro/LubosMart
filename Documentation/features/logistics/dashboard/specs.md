# Logistics Dashboard

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Give an approved active authorized Admin dispatch account a secure view of its organization and sole operational hub, then the parcels requiring action.
- **Current implementation:** `GET /api/v1/logistics/dashboard` remains the safe hub identity scaffold. `GET /api/v1/logistics/dashboard/queue` returns the private scoped Shipment queue used by the dashboard and role-specific workspaces. `/receive-at-hub`, `/sorting`, and `/dispatch` own receipt, normal sortation, and scheduled dispatch respectively; `/operations` provides evidence review and exceptional recovery compatibility.
- **Parcel search behavior:** `/operations` requests ten online queue rows at a time and uses the existing server pagination contract. It stores only safe queue/detail projections in a browser cache keyed by the authenticated organization and sole hub. Camera scanning tries the 1D Code 128 tracking barcode first and accepts only an LuboSmart waybill QR if the bars cannot be decoded. Captured or manually supplied values are decoded locally first; online lookup then supplies authoritative parcel details and status, while offline views are explicitly read-only cached projections.
- **MVP boundary:** One authorized Admin dispatch account operates one organization and exactly one hub/sorting center. Sub-hubs, hub selectors, multi-hub queues, and staff-account context are out of scope.
- **Queue boundary:** Only already-created shared Shipment records are listed. Queue reads never lazily create a Shipment or infer readiness; reference lookup remains the owning Update Status operation.
- **Ownership:** Dashboard reads and aggregates. Seller Prepare Orders owns readiness; Deploy Rider owns assignment; Update Status owns validated state recovery; Waybill owns document access; Courier UI is external React/mobile-only.
- **Non-goals:** Seller processing, parcel mutation, waybill generation, scan validation, Courier assignment, route calculation, proof of delivery, billing, and financial reporting.

## MUST

### Authentication and scope

- Require `auth:sanctum` and `logistics.active` for the dashboard and every future data source.
- Derive `user → logistics_organization → sole hub` on the server. Reject client-supplied organization, hub, Seller, Order, Courier, or status authority.
- Buyer, Seller, Admin, Courier, pending, rejected, suspended, and deactivated accounts receive no dashboard data.
- Scope every row, count, identifier, cache key, event, and private channel to the authenticated organization's sole hub. IDOR-safe not-found/forbidden behavior must not disclose another organization.
- Do not add a subscription gate until a separate Subscription policy exists.

### Current scaffold contract

- Return `hub.id`, `hub.name`, and safe barangay/city/municipality/province/region summary only.
- The base `/dashboard` scaffold continues to return `summary: null`, an empty `orders` list, and server `generated_at` with `freshness.state = scaffold`; authoritative queue data is obtained from `/dashboard/queue`.
- Use `Cache-Control: private, no-store`; one organization's hub projection must never be shared-cached.
- Distinguish unavailable, empty, zero, stale, partial, and failed sections. A null scaffold is not an authoritative zero.
- Reads and refreshes never mutate Orders, Inventory, assignments, evidence, hub state, or history.

### Queue and task projections

- Include a row only when the pickup request's immutable Seller-selected LuboSmart dispatch operation is this organization and preparation has committed `ready_for_pickup`. The current provider-less rows remain transitional and cannot be claimed by any tenant.
- Later rows may enter only through approved Shipment/Delivery Task ownership and transitions: first-mile `picked_up_from_seller`, hub `received_at_hub`/`sorted_at_hub`, `in_transfer`, `dispatched_from_hub`, and final-mile `delivery_assigned`/`picked_up_from_hub`.
- Keep high-level Order values lowercase `snake_case`: `ready_for_pickup`, `picked_up` (explicit first-mile Seller handoff projection), `assigned` (committed scheduled final-mile assignment), `in_transit`, and `out_for_delivery`. Uppercase labels such as `READY_FOR_PICKUP` or `AT_SORTING_CENTER` are source/UI wording only.
- Do not accept or persist a future/source status until the shared operational schema and transition service approve it. Dashboard display must not turn a label into state.
- Exclude Cart rows, unaccepted/unpacked Orders, cancelled/rejected/payment-invalid records, completed history, and records outside the sole hub.

### Operational queue contract

- `GET /api/v1/logistics/dashboard/queue` is implemented and private. It accepts bounded `status`, `evidence_status`, `search`, `per_page` (1–25), and `page` filters; the server derives organization and sole-hub scope.
- A response contains `data` Shipment projections, `summary` counts, deterministic `meta` pagination, and `freshness.state = authoritative`. Missing records are an empty authoritative result, not fabricated work.
- Queue rows are active operational work; completed `delivered` history is excluded. Summary counts therefore describe the same active queue projection and do not turn archived delivery history into work.
- Errors distinguish unauthorized, forbidden/not-found, validation, rate-limit, timeout, and partial-source failure. Retrying a read is safe and cannot mutate operational state.
- Row status includes the machine value, revision, last activity, allowed next states, and task projections. Rejected offer history includes reason/time; the UI exposes last activity without inventing a stale deadline.
- Evidence fields expose only safe state and opaque references, never raw blob paths or private image bytes. `submitted`/`awaiting_validation` does not mean `validated` or physically received.
- Pagination is deterministic and bounded. Repeated requests with the same page, filters, and scope return the same committed projection or an explicit freshness change.
- The Parcel search UI requests `per_page=10`, renders server pagination, and labels offline cache results separately from authoritative responses.

### Open questions

- Confirm the informational stale/aging threshold and polling/private-realtime transport. Until then, the queue exposes `last_activity_at` only and never auto-reassigns work.
- Evidence filtering currently means validation status (`submitted`, `awaiting_validation`, `validated`, or `rejected`); physical-event filtering remains deferred.

### DTO, refresh, and UI safety

- Rows contain opaque Order/Parcel/Waybill references, status/revision/last activity, task leg/status, safe Courier identity, pickup/destination areas, offer history, and evidence status/references. Deploy Rider candidate responses expose provider-neutral distance/ETA fields, explicitly unavailable when not calculated.
- Exclude payment credentials, private registration/POD evidence, raw storage paths, unrestricted Courier location history, and unrelated personal data.
- Polling or private realtime may trigger refetches only after an owning contract exists; authorize channels to the organization/hub.
- Out-of-order refreshes, retries, and communication failures must not duplicate rows or roll back a committed Logistics decision.
- Use responsive, keyboard-accessible controls, visible focus, readable text labels, and non-color-only state indicators.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] An approved active authorized Admin dispatch account can access the protected hub scaffold.
- [x] The current response contains only the account's sole-hub summary and safe freshness metadata.
- [x] The scaffold truthfully returns null/empty data rather than fabricated queue counts.
- [x] Loading, refresh, unauthorized, and recoverable error states are available in the SPA.
- [x] Organization/sole-hub scoped queue rows, real counts, status/search/evidence filters, bounded pagination, authoritative freshness, and truthful empty/error states are implemented.
- [x] Parcel search has tenant-scoped offline queue/detail cache, local barcode/QR decoding with online authoritative lookup, ten-row online pagination, camera scanning, and read-only cached fallback.
- [x] Evidence status, completion intents, and recovery transitions remain visible in Hub operations; receipt, sorting, and scheduled dispatch are separated into their own navigation and pages.
- [ ] A configured stale threshold, private realtime transport, advanced ranking, date filters, and automatic reassignment remain deferred.

## HOW

### Current interfaces

- API route: `GET /api/v1/logistics/dashboard` in `app/routes/api.php`.
- API route: `GET /api/v1/logistics/dashboard/queue` in `app/routes/api.php`.
- Controller: `app/Http/Controllers/Logistics/DashboardController.php`.
- SPA: `resources/js/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/FulfillmentOperationsPage.tsx`, `LogisticsLayout.tsx`, `ProtectedRoute.tsx`, and `auth/AuthContext.tsx`.
- Current migrations provide Logistics identity, organization, sole hub, pickup requests, shared waybills, schedules, first-mile assignment/acceptance, and the additive Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask final-mile records.
- Queue reads are implemented by `FulfillmentTransitionService::logisticsQueue`; operational mutations remain owned by Update Status and Deploy Rider. The dashboard does not redefine transition or eligibility rules.
- Dashboard mutations are never a substitute for Deploy Rider or Update Status authorization.

### Deferred dashboard work

- Configure a concrete stale threshold and optional private realtime/polling transport.
- Add any future date filters, advanced ranking, and exception automation only through owning specs and server contracts.

### Observability and rollout

- Record generated time, correlation ID, query scope, source freshness, and section failures without logging private evidence or unrestricted location history.
- Enable operational sections only after their migrations and owning endpoints are deployed; the scaffold must remain truthful during partial rollout.

### Contract status

- This specification documents the scaffold and deployed queue projection; it does not authorize unsupported runtime routes or migrations by itself.
- Any new queue action must name its owning feature, API version, migration, and test coverage before the Dashboard links to it.

### User-facing states

- The page must distinguish hub loaded, queue unavailable, authoritative empty, filtered empty, stale/partial, unauthorized, and retryable failure.
- Rejected-task rows show why the offer is available for re-offer; stale rows show age and require an explicit Logistics action rather than automatic reassignment.
- Evidence status uses text and accessible labels so a Logistics operator can tell “awaiting validation” from “validated” without relying on color.

### Tests and references

- Test role/status/tenant isolation, sole-hub scope, row/count consistency, pagination, IDOR, DTO privacy, rejected/re-offer, stale, evidence states, retry ordering, and notification/realtime failure.
- Canonical references: `Documentation/requirements.md`, `Documentation/workspace.md`, `Documentation/schema.md`, `Documentation/domains/Logistics.md`, and `Documentation/features/shared/shipment-fulfillment/spec.md`.
