# Deploy Rider

## Courier batch handoff revision (2026-09-20)

The existing 1–15 parcel dispatch schedule is one final-mile offer to its assigned Courier. The Courier accepts all offered member tasks atomically from the schedule, while each parcel retains its own task, offer, Shipment, proof, completion, and history. Rejected legacy or exceptional task offers retain the existing re-offer path. Linehaul manifests are separate and cannot appear in final-mile batch acceptance or routing.

The accepted batch route is calculated with Geoapify Matrix and Routing from confirmed hub/Buyer coordinate pairs. It is advisory, bounded to the schedule, and cannot authorize dispatch or delivery. Missing coordinates or provider failure keeps the schedule and parcel address list available. The older single-task normal-offer and vendor-neutral route language below is historical for this revised flow.

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Let an authorized authorized Admin dispatch account select and offer an eligible Courier for one operational task.
- **Current implementation:** `/dispatch` lists only server-committed `sorted_at_hub` parcels and lets Logistics select 1–15 parcels, one active approved affiliated Courier, and one future delivery time. The dedicated `/sorting` workspace commits that prerequisite only after successful standard-lane synchronization. `POST /api/v1/logistics/dispatch/schedules` atomically creates the schedule, dispatch milestones, one final-mile task/offer per parcel, and the Buyer-facing `assigned` projection. Existing single-task candidate/offer routes remain available for rejected-offer recovery.
- **Core flow:** Logistics resolves a received parcel through a standard Sorting lane → it enters **Ready to dispatch** after server synchronization → Admin dispatch operations create one schedule for one Courier and at most 15 parcels → each parcel receives its own final-mile task/offer → Courier accepts each task.
- **Task boundary:** Each deployed Delivery Task represents exactly one Order/Parcel for one leg. A pickup schedule may group Orders but never merges their tasks, waybills, snapshots, or history.
- **Non-goals:** Courier registration/approval, availability management, vehicle or zone CRUD, waybill generation, physical scans, pickup confirmation, proof of delivery, route navigation, billing, and multi-hub operations.

## MUST

### Authorization and tenant scope

- Require `auth:sanctum` and the active Logistics role/status on every endpoint.
- Resolve the authenticated user to its one LuboSmart dispatch operation and sole operational hub. Never trust client organization, hub, Seller, Order, task, or Courier ownership fields.
- The selected Seller LuboSmart dispatch operation is immutable. A authorized Admin dispatch account may dispatch only tasks addressed to its organization and sole hub.
- Recheck Courier affiliation, account status, and organization scope at commit time. Shared-email records or a guessed UUID do not grant access.

### Task readiness and assignment ownership

- First-mile offering is allowed only after Seller `ready_for_pickup` and one valid selected LuboSmart dispatch operation exist. Creation is at most one active task per Order/Parcel leg and is idempotent.
- Scheduled final-mile offering is allowed only from `sorted_at_hub`. The schedule transaction records `dispatched_from_hub` and the final-mile offer together; a half-created schedule or unassigned dispatched parcel cannot commit.
- Dispatch filters/counts parcels by lane and pages oldest receipt first. One source lane is the default; `combine_lanes: true` explicitly permits active standard lanes from the sole hub.
- Lane-sorted parcels require matching assignment IDs and Shipment/lane revisions; a stale selection conflicts before any schedule commits. Preserve lane ID/code/name/revision and session in each membership; legacy lane-less parcels remain explicitly unassigned.
- Sorted parcels may dispatch before session closure; held exceptions cannot dispatch or bypass the hold through a generic sort transition. Online lane moves are permitted only before dispatch.
- Admin dispatch operations create and offers/assigns work. A Courier may accept only its own offer and cannot assign itself or another Courier.
- Offering or assigning a Courier never means the parcel was physically picked up and must not directly write `picked_up_from_seller`, `picked_up_from_hub`, or a generic Order `picked_up`.

### Status and leg boundary

- First-mile task states are `awaiting_seller_pickup` → `seller_pickup_assigned` → `seller_pickup_accepted` → `picked_up_from_seller`.
- Hub states are recorded by Logistics: `received_at_hub` → `sorted_at_hub` → `dispatched_from_hub`. Internal transfer execution is deferred; no dummy transfer is required.
- Final-mile task states are `delivery_assigned` → `delivery_accepted` → `picked_up_from_hub` → `in_transit` → `out_for_delivery` → `delivered`.
- `assigned` and `picked_up` remain broad Order projections; Deploy Rider must not replace them with detailed task states or write them directly.
- A Courier's acceptance is a separate Courier-owned action. First-mile completion does not grant or require final-mile assignment.

### Candidate data and route context

- Automatic offer expiry is deferred; offers have no MVP expiry deadline. Re-offer after rejection appends a new offer on the same task and restores the leg-specific offered state, without changing custody or the Order.

- Candidate discovery is limited to active Couriers affiliated with this LuboSmart dispatch operation and eligible for the task. Each Courier's sole vehicle is owned by the registration/registry contract. Vehicle maintenance, history, capacity values/units, and capacity matching are deferred and must not introduce candidate eligibility gates; preserve existing availability and schedule checks.
- Pickup and destination come from immutable Seller/Buyer snapshots and the task's authorized hub context; Deploy Rider cannot edit either address.
- The server may return provider-neutral `distance_km` and `estimated_duration_minutes` for candidate ranking and Courier task context. They are advisory, may be unavailable, and are never accepted from the client as authoritative values.
- No particular map or routing vendor is selected. Route suggestions must not decide eligibility, ownership, assignment, or status; missing/stale location is not zero distance.
- Do not expose unrestricted Courier GPS history, payment data, private evidence, raw storage paths, or unrelated Buyer/Seller PII.

### Rejection, re-offer, and staleness

- A Courier rejection records task-level `rejected`, preserves the offer history and reason/time, and leaves the Order unchanged.
- Admin dispatch operations may offer the same task to another eligible Courier; re-offer must not create a new Order, waybill, or merged task and must not erase the prior rejection.
- An unfinished task may be displayed as informationally `stale`. It is not automatically cancelled or reassigned in the MVP.
- Concurrent or retried offer/re-offer requests must return the committed projection or a conflict, never duplicate active offers or overwrite history.

### Implemented API contract

- `GET /api/v1/logistics/deploy-rider/tasks/{task}/candidates` — implemented; returns active approved affiliated Couriers with safe identity and explicit unavailable route metrics.
- `POST /api/v1/logistics/deploy-rider/tasks/{task}/offers` — implemented; accepts `courier_id`, `expected_task_revision`, and a UUID `Idempotency-Key`; creates or re-offers the same final-mile task after rejection.
- `GET /api/v1/logistics/dispatch/couriers` — implemented; returns only active approved Couriers affiliated with the authenticated organization/sole hub, including operational contact number.
- `GET /api/v1/logistics/dispatch/schedules` and `POST /api/v1/logistics/dispatch/schedules` — implemented; list the 50 latest scoped schedules and create an idempotent future schedule for 1–15 unique sorted Shipment UUIDs.
- The dedicated Dispatch UI (`resources/js/pages/DispatchPage.tsx`) owns initial scheduled offers and rejected-offer recovery. It shows only sorted parcels as ready for a new schedule, preserves rejected offer history, and reuses the single-task offer endpoint for re-offer without creating another schedule or parcel.
- A successful offer response contains the task reference, leg, offer/assignment state, Courier reference, server-calculated distance/ETA when available, and immutable event identifiers. It does not claim physical pickup.
- Errors distinguish `401`, `403`, `404`, `409` stale/concurrent state, `422` invalid task/Courier, `429`, and provider-unavailable context. Retrying the same idempotency key is safe; a changed payload conflicts.

### Failure and reliability rules

- No eligible Courier, invalid/stale location, or unavailable distance/ETA produces an explicit unavailable/empty result; it is never treated as zero distance or a forced assignment.
- If the task or Courier changes between candidate retrieval and offer, return the authoritative current projection with a conflict and require refresh.
- A rejected offer is not an Order rejection. Notification or realtime failure after an offer commits does not undo the offer; the Dashboard can refetch it.
- Route results may be short-lived and provider-neutral, but stale route data cannot override server eligibility or assignment checks.

### Open questions

- Confirm the GPS freshness threshold, candidate radius/limit, and whether ranking prefers distance or estimated duration.
- Confirm future zone checks and automated dispatch separately. Vehicle-capacity and maintenance gating are deferred, not unresolved MVP prerequisites.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Only the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation can list candidates or offer a task.
- [x] Final-mile offering requires approved hub dispatch; first-mile offering remains owned by its existing pickup workflow.
- [x] Candidate eligibility is server-derived and revalidated at commit time.
- [x] Distance/ETA fields are provider-neutral, advisory, and explicitly unavailable when calculation is not configured.
- [x] A rejected offer is visible to Logistics, leaves the Order unchanged, and permits re-offer of the same task.
- [ ] Informational `stale` does not automatically cancel or reassign unfinished work.
- [x] First-mile and final-mile assignments remain independent and Courier acceptance is separate from Logistics offering.
- [x] Retries/concurrency cannot duplicate active offers or overwrite append-only assignment history.
- [x] Offering a Courier never records physical pickup or bypasses scan/evidence validation.
- [x] DTOs and logs exclude secrets, raw storage paths, unrestricted location history, and unrelated PII.
- [x] Sorted parcels appear in a dedicated Ready to dispatch queue and cannot be dispatched from Hub operations.
- [x] One schedule assigns one eligible Courier to at most 15 parcels while retaining one Shipment, Parcel, waybill, task, offer, and history per Order.
- [x] Schedule creation is atomic and idempotent; all selected parcels dispatch and receive offers or none do.
- [x] Buyer Order detail shows the committed delivery state plus the assigned Courier name and contact number.
- [ ] Automated ranking/expiry, stale threshold, and MySQL/concurrency release verification remain open.

### Hub-routing API integration (2026-09-18)

`Documentation/features/logistics/hub-to-hub-routing/specs.md` extends the API with separate hub transfer custody. Final-mile schedules/offers remain restricted to a completed destination-hub route or same-hub/legacy flow. Final-mile Courier affiliation, task access, hub pickup context, and evidence/completion notifications use the current organization/hub; the immutable Seller-selected provider remains the origin. Transfers do not assign a final-mile Courier or change Order status. No dispatch UI or linehaul Courier automation is introduced by this extension.

## HOW

### Implementation boundary

- The deployed UI consumes the shared Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask projection and does not create or redefine status columns. The additive fulfillment migration remains the schema source of truth.
- Use one transition/assignment service for readiness checks, sole-hub scope, eligibility, revision locking, idempotency, and append-only offer history. The Dashboard consumes its projection.
- Keep Courier acceptance in the Courier feature/API. A successful Logistics offer makes a task available to that external React client; it does not mark acceptance.

### UI and reliability

- The Logistics UI shows candidate loading, empty/no-eligible, unavailable distance/ETA, rejection/re-offer, conflict, success, and retry states with text and keyboard-accessible controls. A concrete stale threshold remains deferred; last activity is shown by the Dashboard contract.
- Refresh after a committed offer; communication or notification failure must not roll back the assignment decision.
- Keep route calculations and credentials behind a server adapter; do not make a map vendor a schema or state authority.

The dispatch confirmation must show the task/leg, pickup and destination summaries, selected Courier, availability, location freshness, and advisory distance/ETA. It must clearly state that the Courier still has to accept and that physical pickup is not yet recorded.

### Rollout boundary

- Keep advanced candidate ranking, expiry, and dashboard automation deferred, but keep the implemented candidate/offer API on the shared transition service.
- A feature flag may expose candidate read-only previews first, but previews must use the same tenant predicates and must not create offers.
- Re-offer and stale behavior must be enabled atomically with task-history persistence so a rejected offer cannot disappear from the queue.
- Record rollout/API version in the Logistics client contract so external Courier clients can distinguish unavailable from implemented offers.

### Observability

- Record a correlation ID, Logistics actor, organization/hub, task, Courier, leg, decision (`offered`, `rejected`, `re-offered`, or conflict), and timestamp for each dispatch attempt.
- Metrics should distinguish candidate lookup, offer commit, rejection, re-offer, stale display, and unavailable distance/ETA without logging private GPS or evidence.

### Tests and references

- Test role/tenant/sole-hub isolation, readiness gates, independent legs, candidate bounds, stale/missing location, advisory metrics, rejection/re-offer, duplicate/concurrent offers, IDOR, privacy, and failure recovery on MySQL.
