# Logistics Account Management

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Let an approved active authorized Admin dispatch account view and maintain its own personal profile and the operational identity of its organization and sole hub.
- **Current implementation:** Logistics registration, Admin approval, web Sanctum login/session, `/auth/me`, logout, password recovery, dashboard scaffold, pickup views, the protected account API, and the Account Settings page exist. The account API returns a safe private projection and supports allow-listed profile, organization, sole-hub-label, password, personal profile-photo, and same-premises hub-pin changes. Organization-logo storage, delivery, and UI are not implemented yet.
- **Canonical identity:** `users.role = logistics`; the authenticated `user_id` resolves exactly one `LogisticsProfile`, one `LogisticsOrganization`, and one `LogisticsHub`.
- **MVP cardinality:** one authorized Admin dispatch account → one organization → exactly one operational hub/sorting center. Account Management cannot create, select, rename into, or move to a second hub or sub-hub.
- The registration field **Operational hub/sorting-center address** represents the sole hub address. Any relocation or coordinate change is an operational change, not an ordinary personal-profile edit.
- This is a self-service settings feature. It does not grant operational authority beyond the authenticated organization or replace Admin registration approval.
- **Non-goals:** registration/evidence review, subscription billing or gating, Courier approval, fleet, zones, waybills, orders, parcel/status changes, dispatch, chat, reports, MFA, or a Courier mobile/web UI.

```text
active Logistics session
→ GET current account projection
→ edit an allow-listed personal or organization field
→ server validates and locks the owning rows
→ commit the update (or return 409/422)
→ refresh the projection; sensitive notifications run after commit
```

## MUST

### Access, ownership, and tenant scope

- Require `auth:sanctum` and `logistics.active` for every account endpoint. Resolve `user → logisticsProfile → logisticsOrganization → sole hub` server-side.
- Never accept `user_id`, organization ID, hub ID, email, role, status, approval, subscription, or owner fields as the authority for a write.
- A same-email Buyer, Seller, Admin, or Courier is a different role record and cannot read or mutate Logistics settings. Cross-organization identifiers return ownership-safe `404`/`403`.
- Return `401` for no session, `403` for wrong role/inactive account, `404` for a missing or foreign relationship, `409` for a stale concurrent update, and `422` for invalid or forbidden fields.
- Account Management must fail closed when the active account lacks its required organization or sole hub. It must not create missing relationships as a side effect of a read.

### Editable data and immutability

- Use explicit allowlists and separate personal, organization, and hub forms. The current schema supports personal `first_name`, `middle_name`, `last_name`, `contact_number`, `sex`, and `birth_date`; organization `business_name`; and hub display `name` plus its linked Address.
- Ordinary profile updates may change only the personal fields that the product policy approves. Role, account status, approval/application state, password hash, reviewer fields, and relationships are never editable here.
- Organization `business_name` and hub display name are organization-owned values. A change must be authorized for this account and must not affect another organization or Courier affiliation.
- Do not allow an address edit, hub reassignment, second address, or second hub in the initial account feature. If relocation is later approved, use an additive, reviewable address/version workflow and retain the old operational snapshot; never overwrite a committed pickup/waybill address.
- Hub-pin capture/correction is implemented for the existing hub, separate from personal-profile editing. Reuse PSGC/manual address, intentional Geoapify geocoding, and Leaflet click/drag confirmation; Mapbox is not used.
- `PUT /api/v1/logistics/account/hub-location` accepts JSON `{latitude, longitude, expected_updated_at, reason}` with active Logistics/session/CSRF/consent checks. Both finite coordinates are required; validate latitude -90..90, longitude -180..180, nonempty reason up to 2,000 characters, and an opaque server-issued location revision in `expected_updated_at`.
- Extend the private account projection with `hub.location = {latitude, longitude, expected_updated_at}`; null coordinates mean unpinned. A successful save returns `200` with the refreshed account projection. Reject unknown fields/invalid coordinates with `422`, missing relationships with `404`, and conflicting revisions with `409`; keep existing auth/consent error handling.
- Derive and lock the organization's sole hub and linked Address; save the pair atomically, recording previous/new values, reason, actor, and UTC time in `logistics_hub_location_changes`. The additive hub `location_revision` migration provides the opaque expected revision. After timeout refetch; do not blindly replay with a stale revision.
- Pin correction cannot change textual address, hub identity, Courier affiliation, or existing waybill/Order snapshots. Physical relocation remains deferred. Coordinate proximity alone cannot establish whether relocation occurred; UI explicitly asks the operator to confirm the same registered premises.
- Invalidate future route/ranking caches by coordinate fingerprint after commit. Existing distance and route-manifest calculations include the coordinate pair in their fingerprints, so a new committed pin naturally bypasses prior derived values. Preserve committed manifest/history snapshots; rebuilding an active route requires its owning operational workflow, not a silent Account Settings rewrite.
- Map/provider failure preserves the saved pair and editable draft; no GPS permission is required. Show unpinned, locating, pin-confirmation, saving, conflict, and retry states. No new subscription, approval, or dispatch gate is introduced.
- Email change, phone verification, staff accounts, and organization-level permission delegation remain separate decisions. Personal profile-photo upload is implemented below. The organization business-logo extension below is specified but not implemented; do not expose it as an available control until its API and migration exist.

### Personal profile photo (implemented extension)

- This upload represents the authenticated Logistics person's profile photo. Store its generated object path and validated metadata on `LogisticsProfile`; it must not be used as the organization's business logo.
- Implemented endpoints are `POST /api/v1/logistics/account/profile-photo` (multipart field `photo`), `GET /api/v1/logistics/account/profile-photo` (authorized image delivery), and `DELETE /api/v1/logistics/account/profile-photo`.
- Derive the profile from the authenticated active Logistics user. Ignore or reject client-supplied user, profile, disk, or path values; a authorized Admin dispatch account cannot upload to another user's profile.
- The upload inherits `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`: enforce a strict size below 10 MiB (`10,485,760` bytes), allow only JPEG/JPG, PNG, and WebP, and validate detected MIME, file signature, extension, and successful image decoding server-side. Reject spoofed, corrupt, double-extension, and unsupported files.
- Use the configured Laravel filesystem/object storage (Azure Blob when configured). Generate a server-owned UUID object key such as `logistics-profile-photos/{user UUID}/{asset UUID}.{extension}`; never use the original filename as the storage path.
- The additive `2026_09_10_000010_add_logistics_profile_photo_metadata.php` migration stores nullable disk, path, detected MIME, byte size, width, and height metadata. Store no credentials, absolute paths, browser blobs, data URIs, or expiring URLs in the database.
- Replace atomically from the caller's perspective: validate and store the new object, update profile metadata in a transaction, delete the old object only after commit, and clean up the new object if persistence fails. Deletion is idempotent; failed old-object cleanup is observable and retryable without restoring stale metadata.
- Profile-photo delivery is private and owner-authorized through the active authorized Admin dispatch account, with `no-store` and `nosniff` headers. The account DTO returns only a capability path, never a raw storage path or public URL.
- Return `401` for no session, `403` for wrong role/inactive account, `404` when no photo exists, `422` for file validation failures, and `429` for upload throttling. Successful mutations return the safe account projection.
- The Personal profile section shows initials or the private photo, accepted formats and size limit, selection feedback, upload progress, retry/validation errors, and remove confirmation. It must not claim success until storage and metadata persistence complete.

### Organization business logo (specified extension; not yet implemented)

- This upload represents the LuboSmart dispatch operation's business identity, not the authenticated person's profile photo. Store it on `LogisticsOrganization`; do not add `profile_photo_*` fields to `LogisticsProfile` for this purpose.
- Planned endpoints are `POST /api/v1/logistics/account/organization/logo` (multipart upload with field `logo`), `GET /api/v1/logistics/account/organization/logo` (authorized image delivery), and `DELETE /api/v1/logistics/account/organization/logo`. Until implemented, these routes are unavailable and must not be called by the SPA.
- Derive the organization from the authenticated active Logistics user → profile → organization chain. Ignore or reject client-supplied user, organization, owner, disk, or path values; a authorized Admin dispatch account cannot upload to another organization's logo.
- The upload inherits `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`: enforce a strict size below 10 MiB (`10,485,760` bytes), allow only JPEG/JPG, PNG, and WebP, and validate detected MIME, file signature, extension, and successful image decoding server-side. Reject spoofed, corrupt, double-extension, and unsupported files.
- Use the configured Laravel filesystem/object storage (Azure Blob when configured). Generate a server-owned UUID object key such as `logistics-organization-logos/{organization UUID}/{asset UUID}.{extension}`; never use the original filename as the storage path.
- An additive migration may add nullable `logo_disk`, `logo_path`, `logo_mime`, `logo_size`, `logo_width`, and `logo_height` metadata to `logistics_organizations`. Store no credentials, absolute paths, browser blobs, data URIs, or expiring URLs in the database.
- Replace atomically from the caller's perspective: validate and store the new object, update the organization metadata in a transaction, delete the old object only after commit, and clean up the new object if persistence fails. Deletion is idempotent; failed old-object cleanup is observable and retryable without restoring stale metadata.
- By default, logo delivery is organization-owner/admin-authorized and private, with `no-store` and `nosniff` headers. Any Seller/Buyer logistics-provider card or public URL requires a separately approved visibility and DTO contract; never return a raw storage path.
- Return `401` for no session, `403` for wrong role/inactive or foreign ownership, `404` when no logo exists, `422` for file validation failures, and `429` for upload throttling. A successful mutation returns the safe account projection or logo capability, never a storage path.
- The Organization section of Account Settings should show an empty state, selected-logo preview, upload progress, remove confirmation, validation errors, retry state, and unauthorized/network failures. It must not claim success until storage and metadata persistence complete.

### Password and authentication boundary

- The implemented `PUT /api/v1/logistics/account/password` requires the current password, confirmation, and the shared password policy; it never accepts or returns a password hash.
- Password changes are separate from profile/organization updates. Apply rate limiting and preserve the configured session/token revocation policy atomically.
- Existing `/auth/forgot-password` and `/auth/reset-password` remain owned by Logistics Authentication. Account Management does not approve, activate, reject, or reset another role.
- Email verification, MFA, recent-authentication challenges, and concurrent-session management require separate approved contracts; do not infer them from the settings screen.

### Approval, subscription, and operational boundaries

- Admin remains the authority for Logistics registration approval/rejection and account lifecycle changes. Account Management cannot self-approve, clear rejection, change `users.status`, or edit registration evidence.
- Subscription is not an MVP gate. Profile changes must not activate, cancel, charge, or alter subscription entitlements; billing/provider records are deferred.
- Updating an organization or hub label must not mutate Orders, Inventory, waybills, pickup schedules, Couriers, affiliations, routes, or operational statuses.
- Operational DTOs and logs omit passwords, tokens, private evidence, payment secrets, raw storage paths, unrelated-user data, and unnecessary full addresses.

### Consistency, errors, and notifications

- Use PATCH semantics for partial profile/organization changes, validate every submitted key, and reject forbidden keys rather than silently mass-assigning them.
- Lock the authenticated profile/organization/hub rows, re-read current values, and commit all related changes in one transaction. A failed write leaves the prior projection intact.
- Use an expected revision or server version when the supporting migration is approved. Until then, row locking plus current-value comparison must prevent stale overwrites.
- Replayed updates may safely return the latest projection but must not duplicate account events or notifications. If idempotency storage is added, scope it to the Logistics user and request hash.
- Send security/account-change notifications only after commit. Provider failure cannot roll back a successful profile change; retry/observability is separate.

### Admin Dispatch Operations SPA experience

- Use the existing protected Account Settings route, Sanctum credentialed requests, and shared `@lubosmart/ui` components. Profile-photo controls are implemented; add business-logo controls only after the logo API contract exists. Do not add a Courier web page.
- Separate **Personal profile**, **Organization**, **Operational hub**, and **Security** sections. Clearly label the hub as the sole operational hub/sorting center, not a personal residence.
- Show loading, saved, validation, conflict, unauthorized, missing-hub, network, and retry states. Do not optimistically claim a save before the server projection returns.
- Use semantic labels, keyboard-accessible controls, visible focus, field-level errors, responsive dark-mode dashboard styling, and non-color-only status/error cues.
- Account Settings is linked from the protected Logistics navigation. Existing authentication and `/auth/me` behavior remains unchanged; the settings page refreshes the shell projection after a successful organization update.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Own-hub pin read/save API and UI validate complete coordinates and record same-premises corrections without changing hub identity or historical snapshots.
- [x] Stale writes, cross-organization access, malformed pairs, GPS denial, and provider failures preserve the prior authoritative location.
- [x] Route-cache invalidation affects future calculations only; active routes and committed manifests are not silently rewritten.
- [x] The implemented auth resource exposes the authenticated Logistics profile, organization, and sole-hub identity without credentials or private evidence.
- [x] Admin approval and `logistics.active` gate protected Logistics access; subscription status does not gate the MVP.
- [x] The foundation enforces one organization per authorized Admin dispatch account and one hub per organization.
- [x] An authenticated authorized Admin dispatch account can read only its own safe account projection through `GET /api/v1/logistics/account`.
- [x] Allow-listed personal and organization fields can be updated transactionally; forbidden role/status/approval/subscription fields are rejected.
- [x] Hub address relocation is blocked until a separately approved reviewable versioning workflow exists; no second hub/address can be created.
- [x] Password change is rate-limited, current-password protected, and follows the configured session/token policy.
- [x] Concurrent/retried writes preserve the latest committed projection without duplicate events or notifications.
- [x] The Logistics Account Settings UI handles loading, validation, conflict, retry, unauthorized, and success states accessibly.
- [x] A authorized Admin dispatch account can upload, replace, retrieve, and remove only its own valid personal profile photo through the protected profile-photo endpoints.
- [x] Profile-photo validation enforces the shared under-10-MiB JPEG/JPG/PNG/WebP policy, persists only approved metadata, and never exposes a raw storage path.
- [x] Profile-photo replacement/removal cleanup is transaction-safe and idempotent; storage failures cannot leave new metadata pointing at an uncommitted object.
- [x] Private profile-photo delivery is authorized and uses no-store/nosniff response headers.
- [x] The Logistics SPA exposes accessible profile-photo initials/preview, progress, validation, retry, removal, and unauthorized states.
- [x] The organization can upload, replace, retrieve, and remove only its own valid business logo through the approved logo endpoints.
- [x] Logo validation enforces the shared under-10-MiB JPEG/JPG/PNG/WebP policy, persists only approved metadata, and never exposes a raw storage path.
- [x] Replacement/removal cleanup is transaction-safe and idempotent; storage failures cannot roll back a committed metadata decision or resurrect an old logo.
- [x] Private logo delivery is authorized and no-store by default; any buyer/seller-visible delivery has a separate approved visibility contract.
- [x] The Logistics SPA exposes accessible organization-logo empty, preview, progress, validation, retry, removal, and unauthorized states only after backend support exists.

## HOW

### Current code and interfaces

- Existing routes are `POST /api/v1/logistics/auth/register`, `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, protected `GET /api/v1/logistics/auth/me`/`POST /logout`, `GET /api/v1/logistics/dashboard`, pickup/Courier-approval routes, and the account routes below.
- Existing implementation uses `Logistics\\AuthController`, `LogisticsUserResource`, `LogisticsProfile`, `LogisticsOrganization`, `LogisticsHub`, `EnsureActiveLogistics`, and `2026_09_05_000001_create_logistics_foundation_tables.php`.
- Implemented routes are `GET /api/v1/logistics/account`, `PATCH /api/v1/logistics/account/profile`, `PATCH /api/v1/logistics/account/organization`, `PUT /api/v1/logistics/account/hub-location`, throttled `PUT /api/v1/logistics/account/password`, and the throttled/private profile-photo routes. The organization payload may update `business_name` and the sole hub's display `hub_name`; the location payload changes only the complete coordinate pair and cannot change textual address or the hub relationship.
- Responses return a private/no-store JSON projection with safe personal fields, a profile-photo capability path, organization name, sole-hub name, and approved address summary. Never return raw database/storage paths or client-controlled ownership fields.

### Implementation and data flow

- Authenticate active Logistics user → load exact profile/organization/sole hub → validate allow-listed payload → lock rows → write the transaction → return the fresh projection. Account mutations are application-logged with request context; no notification provider is attached to this Phase 1 settings flow.
- Profile-photo mutations validate and store the object before locking the authenticated profile, commit metadata atomically, remove replaced objects after commit, and return the refreshed projection. Photo metadata is additive and does not change hub or organization cardinality.
- Reuse the existing models and `HasBirthDateAge` accessor. Age is derived from persisted `birth_date`; never accept or persist a client-supplied age.
- Add only additive migrations for approved revision/history/idempotency data. Keep enum-like columns string-backed with PHP enum casts and never edit executed migrations.
- Do not add a new address provider, subscription table, hub table, staff role, or operational Shipment/Delivery Task record for this feature.
- The planned logo extension requires an additive organization-metadata migration and the shared upload/storage service; it does not create a personal profile photo or a public media catalog.

### Verification and open decisions

- API tests cover role/status gates, missing relationships, field allowlists, organization/hub cardinality, successive writes, password validation/throttling, profile-photo ownership/validation/formats/boundary/replacement/removal/rate limiting, safe DTOs, and no-store headers. SPA type, lint, and production-build checks pass for the protected Account Settings route.
- Future regression coverage should add a true revision/conflict contract, notification failure behavior, and browser-level keyboard/responsive assertions when those supporting contracts are approved.
- Regression coverage must prove that foreign organization/hub identifiers never leak data and that failed transactions preserve the prior profile projection.
- Run focused Logistics API tests and SPA type/lint/build checks before marking any acceptance item implemented.
- Open decisions: exact editable personal fields; whether business-name/hub-label changes need Admin review; relocation/address versioning; email/phone verification; password session revocation; security history; future staff permissions; and whether a separately approved provider directory may display the organization logo or a profile photo.
- Before implementing hub relocation, Courier-impacting changes, or operational status actions, revise the owning Logistics/waybill/pickup specifications and schema together.
