# Linehaul

## Connection and Sort plan revision — 2026-09-20

This is the current product contract. It supersedes conflicting page ownership, connection lifecycle, postal entry, and transfer placement below. Existing route snapshots, server-selected manifests, custody transitions, local sorting, tenant isolation, and final-mile rules still apply. The frontend workspace relocation is implemented; the approval, connection, rejection-reason, and server-side postal validation changes remain planned.

### Active plan and shared postal coverage — 2026-09-20

- The Sort plan page shows only the active plan and its destination lanes, ordered by physical lane number. Plan creation, editing, and selection of a different plan for activation stay in the workspace dialog. Physical lanes and supported postal codes are managed on the main page. The active-plan lanes, physical-lane list, and supported-code list each show eight rows per page with their own Previous/Next controls. The dialog's Save, Activate, and Delete controls align in one consistent action grid.
- Each hub may independently support the same four-digit postal code. The database enforces uniqueness of a code **within one hub**, and the scoped coverage API no longer rejects a code because another hub supports it. Previously committed routes and scans remain unchanged.
- For a new route, consider every active Logistics hub supporting the exact recipient code. If the origin hub supports it, keep the parcel local. Otherwise, find candidates reachable through active, accepted directed connections between active organizations. Compare complete routes using driving time plus the configured handling allowance per hop, then road distance, hop count, and stable hub IDs. This measures network cost; straight-line proximity and an unconnected nearby hub do not decide custody. A candidate may be several connected hops away. Missing coverage, reachable path, or required road metrics holds the route safely. Held origin routes with no committed hops may retry under the existing policy.
- This shared-coverage destination selection and page layout are implemented. Separate partnership approval/live states, rejection reasons, symmetric connection semantics, and server-side supported-code enforcement for plan mappings remain pending.

### Sort plan workspace layout — 2026-09-20

- Create and edit plans in one responsive workspace dialog. At desktop widths, the left side shows the selected plan's name and destination mappings ordered by physical lane number. The right side shows the plan list and the selected plan's Save, Activate, and Delete actions. Selecting another plan on the right replaces the left-side information. Creating a plan starts inactive; activation is a separate explicit action from the right-side list.
- The page outside the dialog shows the active plan, its ordered destination lanes, physical lanes, and supported postal codes. Keep the dialog within the viewport, scroll its work area, and place the plan selector before details on narrow screens. Table data can scroll horizontally at phone widths. Use the existing Logistics color system, restrained borders, compact controls, readable status text, and no decorative dashboard elements.
- Linehaul shows the partner directory and a pending-request dialog. Supported postal codes live in Sort plan; ready groups, departure confirmation, and manifest receipts live in Sorting. Each workspace has a small help control explaining its steps. Preserve dark mode, keyboard access, and visible offline/error states.
- The 2026-09-20 frontend workspace relocation is implemented. Durable approval versus live connection, rejection reasons, symmetric connection semantics, and server-side supported-postal validation remain pending in this revision; the current UI must not imply those transitions are already available.

### WHAT

- **Linehaul** is the Logistics partner connection workspace. It shows other active LuboSmart dispatch operations and lets an approved authorized Admin dispatch account request, approve, connect, or disconnect a partnership. It has no coverage editor, road-measurement form, ready-group controls, or manifest list.
- **Sort plan** owns the current plan/lane setup plus a hub-level **Supported postal codes** list. Normal postal lanes select from that list; next-hub lanes select connected Logistics partners.
- **Sorting** remains the physical scan/reconciliation workspace and gains the existing online linehaul departure and arrival controls moved from Linehaul. Both connected organizations may send and receive transfers along eligible directed route hops.
- Non-goals: warehouse-capacity sensing, automatic connect/disconnect, vehicle scheduling, rerouting committed hops, changes to unrelated fulfillment flows, and a Courier web interface.

### MUST

- The partner directory keeps its existing search, pagination, safe summaries, and tenant isolation. A partner with no current approval has a **Request** action. Requesting creates a pending approval; it does not activate a routing edge or permit a new departure. Duplicate pending requests do not create duplicate rows.
- An incoming request appears in a **Connection requests** modal for the receiving LuboSmart dispatch operation, showing the requester and **Accept** / **Reject** actions. Only the receiver can decide. After either decision, the request disappears from the pending modal; completed decisions remain visible in the relevant partner row/status so they are not lost.
- Reject requires a plain-text reason (1–500 characters). Save the reason with the decision, show it only to the requester and receiver, and include it in the requester's rejected status. A rejected partnership can be requested again; a new request starts pending and does not erase the prior decision audit. Withdrawal clears a pending request without treating it as a rejection.
- Acceptance approves the partnership but does not silently connect it. Once approved, show **Connect** while disconnected and **Disconnect** while connected. Either partner can disconnect the shared live partnership, immediately blocking new route calculations and departures in both directions; reconnecting while approval remains valid needs no new approval. If approval is revoked or either organization becomes inactive, connecting is unavailable.
- A connected partnership permits routing in both directions, represented by the two directed hub edges needed by the existing graph. Each hop still needs usable road metrics and a matching local next-hub lane; connection alone does not make a parcel dispatchable. Disconnect never cancels or rewrites committed route hops, manifests, or in-transit receipts.
- Supported postal codes are scoped to the authenticated organization's sole hub, normalized as exact four-digit codes, and unique per hub. Multiple hubs may support the same code. Manage them on the Sort plan main page with an add control and a readable paginated list, one explicit delete action per code, validation/error feedback, and a confirmation when deletion affects mappings or held parcels.
- The normal postal mapping form offers only active supported codes in a dropdown, excluding codes already mapped in that plan. The API enforces the same rule; submitting an arbitrary four-digit code or a code that lost support fails. Removing support does not silently delete existing plan mappings or rewrite historical scans: show affected mappings as unavailable and hold future matching scans until coverage is restored or the mapping is removed.
- The next-hub mapping selector offers only currently connected active partners. The API rechecks connection, local plan/lane ownership, and revision at save time. A disconnected mapping remains visible and removable but cannot route new scans or departures.
- A recipient outside the local supported postal codes resolves to the lowest-cost reachable supporting hub through authoritative global coverage. The existing Dijkstra path may cross multiple connected hubs; each current hub sorts to its committed immediate next hop. No kilometre threshold or direct-partner requirement replaces that path. Missing coverage, usable path, metrics, or a required local mapping remains an exception hold.
- Keep the platform Linehaul switch, active Logistics/Sanctum access checks, current idempotent manifest and receipt APIs, and destination-only final-mile dispatch. Move operational controls without changing server-owned manifest membership or custody authority.

### HOW

- Extend the existing connection request/consent API with durable approval status, rejection reason, and separate live connection state. Use additive migrations for any new fields/history; string-backed PHP enums for new states. Perform request, decision, connect, and disconnect under revision checks and row locks. Derive both organizations and hubs from authenticated/scoped records; never accept a caller-supplied actor or foreign hub as authority.
- Preserve the current directed graph and metric adapter, but enable both directed edges only while the shared partnership is approved and connected. Recheck this state at route calculation, automatic sorting, and new departure. Keep already departed arrivals available after disconnection or feature pause.
- Reuse `hub_service_areas` as the Supported postal codes source of truth. Move its editor to Sort plan, expose the caller's active entries with the plan overview, and reuse the existing scoped coverage write path. Add server-side support validation to postal plan mapping creation; retain old mappings as unavailable on coverage removal.
- Refactor the Logistics frontend by responsibility: partner directory and requests modal on `/linehaul`; supported-code and physical-lane lists on the Sort plan main page, with plan editing and postal/connected-partner selectors in its dialog; ready groups, departures, and incoming manifest receipts on `/sorting`. Keep compact responsive and dark-mode behavior from `Documentation/design.md`, visible status text, keyboard-accessible modal controls, and safe retry feedback.
- Migrate the existing accepted active links to approved-and-connected where their receiver consent is recorded; keep pending and withdrawn links inactive. Do not grant approval to previously unilateral links. Preserve rejection history and route/manifests through migration and rollback planning.
- Verify request/accept/reject/reason/re-request/withdrawal, connect/disconnect by either side, stale revisions and foreign IDs, postal uniqueness and removal effects, dropdown/API agreement, reverse-direction and A → B → C routing, exception holds, and in-transit receipt after disconnect. Run focused Laravel and Logistics frontend checks; browser-check both modals and responsive layouts.

Implementation note: `receiver_accepted` currently doubles as approval and live consent. This revision requires separate persisted states. The graph requirement follows the existing directed-route model; [NetworkX's shortest-path documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/shortest_paths.html) confirms that directed paths follow only enabled edges with nonnegative weights.

Acceptance for this revision:

- [ ] Request appears in the receiver's modal; acceptance removes it and enables Connect, while rejection removes it and exposes the saved reason to the requester.
- [ ] Connected partners can transfer in both directions; disconnect blocks new routes/departures while committed receipts remain possible.
- [ ] Supported postal codes can be added and deleted in Sort plan; postal lane mapping uses only the supported-code dropdown and holds safely when support is removed.
- [ ] Next-hub lane mapping lists only connected partners, and a distant destination can traverse multiple connected hubs without changing the existing route/custody contract.


## Partner directory and automatic routing revision — 2026-09-19

This revision replaces the hub-selector connection form and supersedes conflicting historical setup/recovery wording below.

- Linehaul lists other active LuboSmart dispatch operations with business name, sole hub, city/province, connection status, and a **Connect** action. The list supports case-insensitive business/hub/location search and 20-row pagination, without the previous 100-hub discovery ceiling. The overview adds `hub_directory` (`current_page`, `last_page`, `total`) and safe directory fields; query parameters are `search` (maximum 100 characters) and `page` (positive integer). No account contacts, full addresses, or foreign plans/lanes are returned.
- Connect sends a directed request using existing tenant-derived API ownership. Only the receiving organization can accept. Pending requests can be withdrawn, accepted partners disconnected, and incoming requests declined. Request/withdrawal writes that omit road measurements preserve previously recorded values; explicit null pairs clear them. Road measurements are optional settings separate from connecting.
- After acceptance, create/activate a Sort plan and map accepted next hubs to local standard transfer lanes. Map locally delivered postal codes to local delivery lanes. Delivery coverage remains authoritative for resolving the final hub; a missing local postal mapping alone does not prove that a parcel belongs elsewhere.
- A nonlocal parcel uses server-side Dijkstra over accepted active directed edges. The objective is driving time plus handling time per transfer, followed by distance and deterministic ties. The next hop determines the local transfer lane and automatic manifest grouping. Physical departure and arrival still require operator confirmation.
- A new automatic sorting capture retries an unresolved/unavailable route only while the parcel is `received_at_hub` at its original hub and the route has **no hops**. The existing route ID and Shipment link are preserved; successful recalculation commits new hops atomically with sorting. Already planned routes, any route with hops, in-transit routes, and manual exception captures are never recalculated. Matching capture retries replay the original scan result.
- Held sorting recalculation may use the existing cached/limited Geoapify road measurement adapter; normal scans of planned/local routes, list refreshes, connection/plan writes, and manifest actions do not request route metrics. Missing destination coverage, accepted paths, measurements, or next-hub lane mappings remain exception holds.

Assessment: explicit partner consent and a discoverable directory improve setup, while Dijkstra finds the best complete supported path rather than repeatedly choosing the geographically nearest hub. Nonnegative travel/handling weights fit [Dijkstra's documented requirements](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/shortest_paths.html). “Too far” means outside the current hub's declared delivery coverage, not an arbitrary kilometre cutoff. A missing destination-hub postal lane is a local sorting configuration error, so forwarding it elsewhere could create loops or incorrect custody. Capacity, vehicle schedules, and dynamic replanning after a committed hop remain outside this implementation.

## Current Linehaul contract (2026-09-19)

This revision supersedes earlier Sorting-embedded transfer UI, unilateral connection setup, and deferred bilateral-consent wording in this specification.

- **Sorting** owns scanning, automatic lane selection, and reconciliation. **Sort plan** maps postal codes and accepted outgoing next hubs to physical standard lanes. **Linehaul** is a separate protected `/linehaul` page with a **Beta** sidebar tag; it owns service coverage, directed connection requests/acceptance/disconnection, grouped departure confirmations, and incoming manifest receipts.
- `PUT /api/v1/logistics/linehaul/connections` requests the authenticated hub's outgoing connection. `is_active=true` records sender intent, but the connection stays inactive until the receiving LuboSmart dispatch operation accepts. Sender writes cannot grant consent. `is_active=false` withdraws the request and revokes consent. Each update requires the existing row revision.
- `GET /api/v1/logistics/linehaul` includes owned outgoing `connections` and receiver-scoped `incoming_connections`, with safe endpoint hub names, `sender_requested`, `receiver_accepted`, `is_active`, and revisions. The Linehaul hub selector lists other active Logistics hubs; the Sort plan selector lists only active, receiver-accepted outgoing hubs.
- `PUT /api/v1/logistics/linehaul/connections/{connection}/consent` accepts `{accept: boolean, expected_revision: integer}`. Only the target LuboSmart dispatch operation can accept, decline, or disconnect; foreign/sender IDs return scoped 404, stale revisions return 409, and withdrawn requests cannot be accepted. Acceptance enables only that directed edge; a reverse connection needs its own request/acceptance. Disabled or suspended endpoints cannot be used in new route calculations.
- Saving a Sort plan hub mapping requires an accepted active connection and never creates/reactivates topology. Automatically scanned transfer parcels use the lane mapped to their committed minimum-time next hop; destination-hub parcels use recipient postal mappings. The objective is total driving time plus 30 minutes handling per hop, then distance, hop count, and stable hub IDs for ties. It is not a promise of minimum geographic distance. Mapping changes do not reroute committed waybills.
- The additive consent migration adds boolean intent/consent fields and disables previously unilateral active connections with a revision increment. Existing Logistics must accept them before future routing/departures. Route/hop history remains immutable; committed in-transit receipts remain available after disconnection or platform shutdown. Rollback removes the consent fields without reactivating links.
- Admin network configuration cannot bypass consent in routing/sorting/departure. Admin deactivation withdraws intent and clears receiver consent. Logistics acceptance remains required for new Admin-configured edges.
- Company-owned trucks, linehaul vehicle/Courier assignments, warehouse capacity, and automatic capacity-based disconnection remain future work.

### Provider usage audit

Dijkstra runs entirely in Laravel. Normal scans of committed routes, plan saves, connection requests/acceptance, departure, receipt, and page refresh do not call Geoapify. Held-route retries at sorting may measure uncached accepted edges as described in the latest revision. New cross-hub waybill snapshots measure only accepted directed edges reachable from the origin that can also reach the destination, excluding outgoing destination edges and dead-end branches. Missing metrics for a relevant alternative still hold the route rather than silently claiming an optimum over incomplete measurements.

Measurements batch uncached edges by source in 1×N matrices and cache successful directed coordinate fingerprints/options for 24 hours. Changed pins invalidate cache keys; same-hub and explicit operator-measured routes avoid provider calls. Server keys and addresses never reach the client. Geoapify's current documented 1×N baseline is N credits, plus `floor(distance_meters / 500000)` per returned distance. Linehaul now records those observed distance surcharges in the shared daily counter as well as reserving baseline credits before requests. Surcharges are unknown before the response, so this guard is an estimate rather than a strict provider billing cap; other consumers/tiles and multi-server deployments require shared cache/account-level monitoring. Committed road metrics remain fixed.

Source: [Geoapify Route Matrix API pricing](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/Documentation/route-matrix/).

Validation covers receiver/sender/foreign access, stale consent, withdrawal, no unilateral reactivation, accepted selector isolation, automatic sorting/manifests, consent migration rollback/backfill with preserved route history, dead-end pruning, immutable routes, cache reuse, and distance-surcharge accounting. The focused consent suite passes on MySQL (9 tests/131 assertions); MySQL passes routing/consent/configuration/path and existing concurrent transfer workers. The pre-existing final-mile migration test uses MySQL PRAGMA and is excluded from MySQL runs, while passing on MySQL. Browser/device and physical handoff verification remain pending.


### Hub selection revision — 2026-09-19

Sort plan `next_hubs` now lists all other active Logistics hubs, rather than only preconfigured outgoing connections. Saving a hub mapping creates or enables the source hub's directed connection in the same transaction, preserving existing road measurements and incrementing revision when reactivating. No Admin permission or approval is required. Self/suspended/missing targets, foreign lanes/plans, and stale revisions remain rejected without topology changes. Removing a mapping does not disable a shared connection; explicit connection management remains available in Sorting. The Admin linehaul switch continues to pause new routes/departures. The sidebar marks Sort plan as Beta. This supersedes the earlier selector/allowed-connection wording below.

## Current contract revision — 2026-09-18

This revision supersedes the earlier disabled-by-default flag, Admin-only network ownership, duration-only objective, and per-parcel frontend confirmations described below. Historical verification figures below describe the previous implementation.

- The feature is called **Linehaul**. Existing hub-routing class names and API URLs remain compatibility identifiers.
- The persisted `linehaul` switch defaults on and appears in Admin **Feature controls**, using the existing permission, revision, and audit contract. It pauses new waybill routes and all new departures, while allowing already departed manifests to arrive. Existing waybills are never retroactively rerouted.
- Active authorized Admin dispatch accounts configure only their own postal service areas and outgoing directed connections through `PUT /api/v1/logistics/linehaul/{service-areas|connections}`. Actor/source hub are server-derived; existing rows require `expected_revision`. One active owner per postal code remains enforced. No additional platform approval or bilateral permission is required.
- Destination resolution remains exact immutable recipient postal coverage. Dijkstra minimizes driving seconds plus a configurable 1,800-second handling allowance per hop, then distance, hop count, and stable IDs. The allowance is an initial application policy, not an industry guarantee. Snapshot duration reports travel only; the objective is `travel_handling_distance`.
- Connections may store both operator-recorded road metres and driving seconds. These explicit measurements take precedence over matrix calls and are snapshotted with operator provenance. Blank pairs use Geoapify. Missing pins/measurements remain a hold; never infer a road or ferry route from straight-line proximity. Physical lane capability is represented by configured edges, not geographic guesses.
- `GET /api/v1/logistics/linehaul` returns this hub's coverage, outgoing connections, bounded active hub names, oldest 100 ready parcels grouped by immediate next hub, and latest 50 manifests involving this hub. No foreign lanes, plans, or recipient information is returned.
- `POST /api/v1/logistics/linehaul/manifests` accepts a `next_hub_id` and UUID `Idempotency-Key`; the server selects the current 1–100 eligible sorted parcels for that configured next-hop group, verifies authoritative custody and mapped lanes, freezes membership, and records all departures in one transaction. Older clients may still submit distinct references for compatibility, but the Sorting UI never asks operators to enter them. The UUID identifies the durable manifest; matching retries replay, changed membership conflicts. The bound is an application limit, not a claimed truck capacity.
- `POST /api/v1/logistics/linehaul/manifests/{manifest}/receive` is destination-scoped and atomically receives every member with locked authoritative revisions; repeated receipts replay. Individual transfer APIs cannot split manifest members. Legacy standalone parcels retain existing per-parcel compatibility endpoints. Deactivated edges do not block receipt of parcels already in transit.
- The Sorting Linehaul panel displays server-created ready groups from the active sort plan and route. The operator chooses a next-hop group and confirms only the physical departure; the API selects all currently eligible sorted parcels for that route and freezes membership in the manifest. Operators never enter parcel IDs. It displays membership and confirms receipt of all parcels. Missing or damaged members require reconciliation before receipt; partial arrival, seals, vehicles, scheduling, and automated physical evidence remain outside this change.
- Sort plan uses create/edit native dialogs, explicit selected-plan actions, and confirmed revision-checked `DELETE /sorting/plans/{plan}`. Deletion preserves scan metadata/history; if the active plan is deleted, no replacement activates implicitly and future sorting falls back to exceptions.

Research: [DHL cross-mode distribution](https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/csi/documents/pdf/glo-csi-cross-mode-direct-ship.pdf) describes unloading, scanning, sorting, consolidation, transport, and destination deconsolidation. [FedEx consolidation](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/international-ground-consolidation.html) describes packages travelling together to a destination gateway. These support consolidation by transport leg and manifest membership; the atomic receipt rule, handling allowance, and bounded batch size are LuboSmart implementation choices.

## WHAT

- Add a server-owned routing loop for parcels whose Buyer destination is outside the current hub's service area.
- Preserve the existing path for local deliveries: Seller pickup → hub receipt → postal-code sorting → final-mile dispatch.
- Keep the invariant that every `LogisticsOrganization` owns exactly one operational `LogisticsHub`. The network graph may connect hubs owned by different organizations; it must not create sub-hubs or a second hub for one organization.
- Resolve the destination hub from the immutable `OrderAddress` postal code and an active, authoritative hub service-area mapping.
- Treat hubs as graph nodes and explicitly approved directed hub connections as graph edges. Geoapify supplies road measurements only; it never creates or authorizes an edge.
- Calculate and snapshot the route when the shared waybill is created. A route such as `Hub A → Hub B → Hub C → Destination Hub` is then the parcel's ordered transfer plan.
- Keep routing responsible for the next hub and sorting responsible for the current hub's local lane. Logistics A must not read or configure Logistics B's internal lanes or sort plans.
- Non-goals: new Courier web UI, buyer-selected hubs, automatic edge discovery, live fleet optimization, containers, returns, rerouting after a failed handoff, transfer penalties, or operating-cost optimization in this phase.
- Operational sequence:
  ```text
  Seller pickup → origin receipt → route-target lane → transfer dispatch
  → next-hub receipt → repeat sorting/dispatch → destination postal lane → final-mile delivery
  ```

## MUST

### Destination and route authority

- Use the waybill's recipient snapshot and normalize its four-digit postal code with the existing sorting convention; never read a mutable Buyer address during fulfillment.
- Set `origin_hub_id` from the Seller-selected provider's sole hub (`seller_pickup_requests.logistics_hub_id` / waybill hub). Set `destination_hub_id` from exactly one active `hub_service_areas` match.
- Do not guess when a postal code is unmapped or maps to multiple active hubs. Persist an `unresolved` route result, hold the parcel in an exception state, and require configuration or an explicit recovery action before dispatch.
- When origin and destination are equal, persist a `local` route with no transfer hops and let the current sorting and final-mile flow run unchanged.
- When they differ, load only active database edges, calculate their current road metrics, and persist the selected ordered hops before the parcel can leave the origin hub.
- Use directed edges. A reverse connection requires its own row because road travel measurements may differ by direction.
- Use Dijkstra with nonnegative edge weights. Default to travel duration in seconds, use total distance as the deterministic tie-breaker, then hop count and stable hub IDs. A bounded node/hop limit must prevent runaway graph work.

### Operational lifecycle

- At waybill creation, persist the route against the immutable waybill identity even though the current implementation materializes `Parcel`/`Shipment` lazily. Attach the route to the Shipment under lock when `ensureForWaybill` later creates or loads it; never create a duplicate Parcel or Shipment.
- Initialize the route's current node from the origin hub. The existing first-mile task, receipt scan, and `received_at_hub` transition remain unchanged for the first hub.
- During sorting, if `current_hub_id != destination_hub_id`, resolve the route's next hop and require an active local lane configured for that target hub. Dispatch the parcel to that hop and record `in_transfer`; do not create a final-mile task or project the Order to `assigned`.
- At the next hub, an authorized receiving operation validates the expected route hop, records arrival, updates the Shipment's current hub scope, and returns it to `received_at_hub`. The same `arrived → sorting → dispatch` cycle repeats.
- Once `current_hub_id == destination_hub_id`, stop consuming transfer hops. The active destination-hub sort plan maps the Buyer postal code to a local standard lane, and the existing `sorted_at_hub → dispatched_from_hub → delivery_assigned` final-mile flow applies.
- `in_transfer` is a Shipment/route milestone and must not be added to `orders.status`. `picked_up` remains the first-mile Order projection; `assigned` remains the committed final-mile assignment projection.
- Add `in_transfer` to the PHP Shipment status enum and string-backed status column for this feature. The transfer departure event owns that state; `dispatched_from_hub` remains the existing final-mile dispatch milestone.
- Snapshot the source lane on transfer departure and clear the live lane/session assignment before the next hub receives the parcel. The next hub starts with no inherited lane and cannot use the previous hub's plan.
- Every transfer departure and arrival is transactional, idempotent, revision-checked, and append-only. A duplicate scan replays its result; a stale hop, foreign hub, inactive connection, or wrong next hub returns a safe conflict/not-found response.

### Lane and tenant boundary

- Extend `sorting_plan_lanes` additively with a string-backed `destination_type` (`postal_code` or `hub`) and nullable `destination_hub_id`; preserve existing postal-code rows and their unique per-plan behavior.
- A `postal_code` destination requires a normalized four-digit code and an active standard lane. A `hub` destination requires a different active hub, an active allowed connection from the current hub, and an active standard lane in the current organization's own plan.
- Automatic sorting must select the lane whose destination matches the route's next hub. A client lane choice is advisory and cannot bypass the route or select a foreign lane.
- Logistics projections expose the current hub, next hub, route status, and safe hop metrics only. They must not expose another organization's lane IDs, plan revisions, or internal layout.
- Admin/platform operations should own service-area and connection configuration through permission-gated APIs. Admin dispatch operations may read the next-hop context needed for its own hub; cross-organization topology editing is an open authorization decision.

### Data model

- Add `hub_service_areas`: `id`, `logistics_hub_id`, normalized `postal_code`, name/description as needed, active flag, revision, creator, and timestamps. Enforce one active destination hub per postal code.
- Add `hub_connections`: `id`, `from_hub_id`, `to_hub_id`, active flag, revision, creator, and timestamps. Enforce unique directed pairs, distinct endpoints, and restrictive hub deletes.
- Add `shipment_routes`: one route per waybill/Shipment, origin and destination hub IDs, route status, algorithm/objective, graph revision, total distance/duration, calculation time, and safe failure metadata. Allow a nullable Shipment link until lazy materialization.
- Add `shipment_route_hops`: route ID, sequence, from/to hub IDs, hop status, distance in meters, duration in seconds, coordinate fingerprints, provider status, departure/arrival actors and times, and idempotency metadata. Preserve the selected metric snapshot after hub coordinates or graph configuration change.
- Add `current_logistics_organization_id` and `current_hub_id` to Shipment while retaining the existing waybill/provider organization and hub as immutable origin context. Initialize both current fields from the existing Shipment fields; all operational scope queries use the current fields after rollout.
- Do not duplicate latitude/longitude or region fields on hubs. Reuse `logistics_hubs.address_id` and its confirmed coordinate pair. All new enum-like columns are database strings with PHP enum casts.

### Geoapify integration and future weights

- Add a server-only Geoapify adapter beside the existing `LogisticsDistanceService`. Use `POST https://api.geoapify.com/v1/routematrix` with `GEOAPIFY_SERVER_API_KEY`, `mode=drive`, and coordinate pairs in `[longitude, latitude]` order.
- Batch only allowed edge endpoints, read `distance` in meters and `time` in seconds, and ignore matrix cells for disallowed pairs. Use the Routing API only for an optional single-hop road trace or fallback measurement; it cannot change graph membership.
- Cache measurements by directed hub pair, coordinate fingerprints, mode, and provider options. On missing coordinates, null routes, timeout, quota, malformed data, or missing key, return an explicit unavailable metric and preserve a retryable route failure; never use zero or a straight-line distance.
- Keep credentials and full addresses off clients and logs. Persist provider name/status, metric timestamps, coordinate fingerprints, and safe request/correlation IDs; include Geoapify/OpenStreetMap attribution wherever metrics are displayed.
- Isolate `RouteWeightCalculator` behind an interface accepting duration, distance, connection metadata, and a future weight context. The current implementation uses duration/distance only; do not add fake zero `transfer_penalty` or `operating_cost` values.
- Future weighting may extend the edge snapshot and calculate a normalized cost such as `duration_weight + distance_weight + transfer_penalty + operating_cost`. Those fields, units, ownership, and currency require a separate policy and migration.

### API, testing, and rollout

- Preserve existing Seller pickup, waybill, receiving, sorting, dispatch, Courier, and Buyer contracts for local routes. Add private route projections, transfer-departure, and transfer-arrival endpoints under `/api/v1/logistics/`; derive actor, organization, and current hub from Sanctum.
- Extend sorting/dispatch responses with destination type, next hub, route hop status, and metric availability. Transfer dispatch must accept current Shipment/hop revisions and an idempotency key; final-mile dispatch remains restricted to the destination hub.
- A route projection should include route status, origin/destination hub summaries, current/next hub, ordered hop sequence, safe distance/duration, and the reason for an unavailable route. Transfer write requests must not accept an arbitrary destination hub or a client-supplied route.
- Cover service-area resolution, same-hub bypass, directed Dijkstra paths, deterministic ties, no path, stale graph/metric data, provider failures, coordinate invalidation, lazy Shipment attachment, cross-tenant IDOR, duplicate scans, concurrent arrival/dispatch, exception holds, and the A → B → C → destination example.
- Roll out additive migrations and route services first, configure and verify service areas/connections second, then enable new waybill route snapshots behind a feature flag. Do not retroactively reroute in-flight waybills without a separately approved reconciliation plan.
- Measure route calculation success/failure, provider latency/quota errors, cache hit rate, no-path holds, transfer dwell time, hop conflicts, and parcels held by unresolved destination data without logging PII or route secrets.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] A new waybill stores its origin, resolved destination, route status, and ordered route hops without changing Order status, inventory, or first-mile behavior.
- [x] A same-hub waybill follows the existing receiving, postal-code sorting, dispatch, and final-mile path with no Geoapify call.
- [x] A cross-hub waybill follows only configured directed edges and selects the deterministic shortest Dijkstra path using travel duration/distance.
- [x] Each current hub can see only its own lane/plan data and the next hub required by the route.
- [x] Transfer dispatch and arrival cannot duplicate, skip, reverse, or complete a route hop through retries or concurrent requests.
- [x] Arrival at the destination hub exits the transfer loop and enables the existing local postal-code final-mile flow.
- [x] Missing service areas, missing coordinates, unavailable provider metrics, and no path create explicit holds and never fabricate a route.
- [x] Hub pin changes and graph edits do not rewrite already committed route-hop measurements.
- [x] Existing Logistics sorting, dispatch, first-mile, final-mile, and Buyer Order status tests continue to pass.

### Open decisions

- Confirm whether both LuboSmart dispatch operations must consent before an Admin activates a cross-organization connection.
- Confirm whether an unresolved destination blocks waybill creation or follows the documented create-and-hold behavior.
- Confirm the transfer handoff actor/evidence contract and the metric refresh/traffic policy before physical linehaul automation is introduced.

## HOW

- Reuse `RequestSellerPickup`, `CreateWaybill`, `SortingPlanService`, `SortingService`, `FulfillmentTransitionService`, and `DispatchScheduleService`; extract only the route/bootstrap logic needed to preserve current lazy Shipment creation and status transitions.
- Keep all custody writes in `FulfillmentTransitionService` or a route-aware extension of it. Add transfer events such as `hub_transfer_dispatched` and `hub_transfer_received` to the existing append-only `shipment_events` history.
- Keep route snapshots immutable for a committed shipment. A later graph edit or hub pin correction affects future calculations and cache keys; it does not rewrite an active parcel's selected hops.
- Verify the additive migrations on MySQL, run focused route/transfer tests, then rerun existing Logistics fulfillment, sorting, dispatch, and Buyer Order status suites. The Logistics Sorting / Sort plan extension is included; external React implementation remains separate.

### Implemented API contract (2026-09-18)

All Logistics endpoints require Sanctum, active Logistics access, and policy consent. Responses are private/no-store. Routing adds no Logistics or Courier UI.

| Method/path | Request | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/logistics/routes/{reference}` | Tracking ID/waybill reference or compatible QR value | Shipment identity/status/revision and safe route projection. Current custody owner may read it; the expected receiving hub may read only this safe projection while its hop is `in_transfer`. |
| `POST /api/v1/logistics/transfers/departures` | Transfer body below and UUID `Idempotency-Key` | Commits `sorted_at_hub → in_transfer`, snapshots the local source lane, clears live lane/session, and appends `hub_transfer_dispatched`. |
| `POST /api/v1/logistics/transfers/arrivals` | Transfer body below and UUID `Idempotency-Key` | Commits the expected arriving hop, changes current organization/hub, resets lane/session, records receipt time, and appends `hub_transfer_received`. |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/hub-routing/service-areas` | Optional `page`, `per_page=1..100` | Bounded configuration list; requires `platform-settings.view`. |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/hub-routing/service-areas` | `logistics_hub_id`, four-digit `postal_code`, optional `is_active` | Creates postal coverage; requires `platform-settings.manage`; one active hub per postal code. |
| `PATCH /api/v1/admin/hub-routing/service-areas/{id}` | `expected_revision`, `is_active` | Revision-checked activation/deactivation; hub/postal identity cannot be changed. |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/hub-routing/connections` | Optional `page`, `per_page=1..100` | Bounded directed-edge list; requires `platform-settings.view`. |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/hub-routing/connections` | `from_hub_id`, `to_hub_id`, optional `is_active` | Creates a unique directed connection between different hubs; requires `platform-settings.manage`. |
| `PATCH /api/v1/admin/hub-routing/connections/{id}` | `expected_revision`, `is_active` | Revision-checked activation/deactivation; endpoints cannot be changed. |

Admin routes also require active Admin access and policy consent. Configuration writes use the existing platform-settings permission boundary and audit outbox. Logistics cannot edit network topology. Admin activation is the implementation baseline; bilateral organization consent remains a policy decision before operational rollout.

```json
{
  "reference": "AWB-TRACKINGREFERENCE",
  "hop_id": "current-hop-uuid",
  "expected_revision": 5,
  "expected_hop_revision": 1
}
```

- Both transfer writes return `200 {data: {shipment_id, status, revision, event_id, route}}`. Matching actor/key/body retries replay the committed transfer result even after custody moves. Changed payloads conflict; foreign references return scoped `404`; stale revisions, skipped hops, inactive connections, and incompatible states return safe `409`. Unknown body fields, arbitrary destinations, and invalid/missing UUID keys return `422`.
- Route status is `local`, `planned`, `unresolved`, `unavailable`, or `completed`. Projection includes origin/destination/current/next hub summaries, ordered hop IDs/statuses/revisions, snapshot metres/seconds, metric availability, safe failure code, and Geoapify/OpenStreetMap attribution. It excludes lanes, plan revisions, coordinate fingerprints, credentials, provider URLs, and full addresses.
- Extend the existing `POST /api/v1/logistics/sorting/plans/{plan}/lanes` with `destination_type=hub` and `destination_hub_id` instead of `postal_code`; the existing `lane_id` and `expected_revision` remain required. Only an active allowed outgoing connection and the caller's active standard lane are valid. Postal mappings retain their existing contract.
- Cross-hub route captures use authoritative routing even when a manual standard lane is supplied. Explicit local exception-lane captures still allow damage/unreadable holds without advancing custody. Missing routes/plans/hub mappings select the active local exception lane. Destination-hub sorting returns to postal-code mappings from the immutable waybill recipient. Same-hub and legacy parcels retain their existing manual sorting/recovery compatibility.
- Shipment records and sorting session item projections add `route`; operational queues, final-mile task reads, delivery hub context, and evidence/completion notifications use current custody scope. A historical session never exposes the next organization's lane/plan. Old receiving/transition retry paths recheck current custody before returning operational details.
- Transfer writes record the authenticated Logistics actor, server timestamp, reference-linked parcel, hop, and append-only custody event. No linehaul Courier assignment or additional handoff evidence contract is invented. First-mile inventory effects and final-mile proof requirements remain unchanged.

### Implementation rollout and verification

- Run additive migrations, seed the existing Admin permissions, configure/verify service areas and directed connections, confirm hub pins, and create each organization's local hub-target/postal sort-plan mappings before enabling `HUB_ROUTING_ENABLED=true` with the server Geoapify key configured.
- The default `HUB_ROUTING_ENABLED=false` controls new waybill snapshot creation only. Disabling it later does not remove committed routes or strand their transfer endpoints. Existing waybills never acquire routes through lazy Shipment reads; no retroactive reconciliation is performed.
- Use bounded graph limits (100 hubs, 300 edges, 32 hops), 1×N matrices grouped by allowed source, and 24-hour coordinate-fingerprint caches. Measure only origin-reachable configured edges; unavailable metrics there hold the route rather than silently optimizing an incomplete graph. Matrix requests share the existing daily credit bucket with pickup manifests. Measurements use explicit `drive`, metric units, free-flow traffic, and balanced road routes; historical hop metrics remain fixed.
- Safe failure codes include `destination_unresolved`, `no_path`, `coordinates_missing`, `key_missing`, `quota`, `timeout`, `malformed`, `provider_error`, `route_unavailable`, `graph_changed`, `graph_limit`, and `hop_limit`. Provider exceptions are not logged because they can include credentials. Safe calculation, metric/cache/latency, and transfer-duration events provide initial observability.
- Held immutable routes are not retried or rerouted by a topology edit or document read. An operational recovery/reconciliation policy and explicit action remain separate; do not enable production routing until handling these holds is agreed. Optional single-hop road traces, live traffic refresh, bilateral connection consent, physical linehaul automation, and additional transfer evidence remain deferred.
- Focused coverage includes route snapshots without materialization, lazy identity attachment, same-hub compatibility, immutable postal routing, directed weighted paths and deterministic ties, no path, graph/hop limits, graph changes, coordinate invalidation, provider/quota failures, exception holds, scoped access, stale/skipped hops, retry replay, and four-hub destination final-mile assignment. MySQL worker tests exercise duplicate departures and competing arrivals on independent connections.

- Verification: focused routing/configuration/path/migration tests pass on MySQL (22 passed, 313 assertions; one MySQL-only concurrency test skipped) and MySQL (23 passed, 338 assertions). Broader MySQL Logistics, Buyer status/mutations, and Seller acceptance coverage passes 92 tests/1,440 assertions with the same concurrency skip; the later targeted fulfillment/routing run passes 31 tests/633 assertions plus that skip. Existing MySQL fulfillment, pickup/waybill, notification, and Buyer status coverage passes 33 tests/708 assertions; its older MySQL-only lane-migration test is excluded there and passes on MySQL. Laravel Pint passes. Geoapify responses are mocked; live road-network/physical handoff verification remains an operational rollout gate.

### Migration boundaries

- Use new timestamped migrations only; do not edit the executed Logistics, waybill, fulfillment, or sorting migrations.
- Add partial unique indexes and check constraints for active service-area ownership, directed edge uniqueness, valid route targets, and ordered hops where the two supported databases allow them.
- Keep route and hop status values as strings and cast them to PHP enums; do not introduce MySQL native enum columns.
- Make all new foreign keys restrictive by default so route history cannot disappear when a hub or connection is retired.

### Admin Dispatch Operations frontend extension (2026-09-18)

Linehaul extends the existing **Sorting** and **Sort plan** pages, with no separate sidebar feature. Sort plan maps either an exact postal code or an allowed next hub to an active standard lane. `GET /api/v1/logistics/sorting/plans` now includes `next_hubs` containing only `{id, name}` for active directed connections from the authenticated hub to active authorized Admin dispatch accounts; foreign topology, lanes, and plans remain excluded. Existing mappings to unavailable hubs remain removable and display an unavailable state.

Sorting reconciliation shows the committed next hub or route hold alongside the authoritative predicted lane. Its **Linehaul** section shows automatically grouped ready parcels and next-hop manifests, with current/destination/next hubs, route-hop states, departure/arrival timestamps, and safe estimated metrics with provider attribution. It confirms physical departure only after sorting at the sending hub, or physical arrival only at the expected receiving hub. Departure requests send only the selected next-hub ID; the server supplies the eligible parcel membership, Shipment/hop revisions, and UUID idempotency key. Ambiguous network failures retain the same request/key for retry during the mounted workspace; a definitive rejection refreshes the computed group. Transfer confirmations are online-only; the existing offline sorting outbox is unchanged. No route editor, reroute, hold-recovery action, provider request, network editor, or linehaul Courier assignment is introduced in Logistics.

Both page headers keep small labelled help and refresh icon buttons at the top right, including mobile. Instructions live in native dialogs. The UI retains project colors and dark mode, uses compact borders/spacing, and adapts the forms, scanner, transfer panel, and reconciliation list across mobile, tablet, FHD, 1980×1080, and wider device viewports.

Frontend acceptance:

- [x] Hub-target mappings extend Sort plan without a separate navigation section and preserve postal-code mappings.
- [x] Sorting displays safe next-hop context and holds without exposing another hub's layout.
- [x] Physical departure/arrival confirmations use authoritative hops, expected revisions, confirmation prompts, and matching-key retries after uncertain network failures.
- [x] Transfer actions require a connection; offline sorting captures keep their existing behavior.
- [x] Compact responsive layouts, dark mode, labelled icon navigation, and top-right help/refresh controls are implemented.
- [x] Logistics JavaScript, lint, and production build pass; focused route/configuration-summary and fulfillment regressions pass (30 tests / 614 assertions).
- [ ] Browser interaction and visual checks at the current device resolution, 1980×1080, 1920×1080, tablet, and mobile, including dark mode, offline failures, and ambiguous-response retry.
- [ ] Physical barcode/camera and real inter-hub handoff verification.

The runtime routing flag still defaults to disabled for newly created waybills. Platform network configuration, hold-recovery policy, bilateral consent, and physical linehaul rollout retain their existing boundaries. Admin network configuration continues through the existing permission-gated API; this extension does not add an Admin frontend.
