# Logistics Notifications

## WHAT

- Provide a persistent in-app inbox, header bell, recent preview, and unread badge for the Logistics operator.
- Reuse the Seller/Buyer list, detail, and mark-read pattern and Admin notification persistence principles.
- This is an in-app notification feature, not SMTP email, marketing campaigns, chat, or an operational audit ledger.
- Existing Logistics inbox APIs and UI project legacy pickup notifications into safe title, summary, and destination fields.
- Courier vehicle edits create `logistics-courier.vehicle-updated` notifications. The backend projects an authorized `/couriers/{courierId}/vehicle` destination, and the Logistics React app opens its protected, read-only current vehicle page.
- One authorized Admin dispatch account operates one organization and its sole hub; do not introduce staff accounts or sub-hub inboxes.
- Source features own business actions; notification screens only read alerts and update their read state.
- Exclude email/SMS/mobile push, WebSockets, arbitrary notification creation, bulk campaigns, delete/archive, and mark-unread in MVP.

```text
source action commits → durable notification work → recipient inbox
→ bell/list/detail → explicit mark-read → authorized owning feature
```

## MUST

### Authorization and scope

- Require `auth:sanctum`, `logistics.active`, and `policy.consent` on all proposed routes.
- Resolve the account, organization, and sole hub from authenticated server relationships.
- Query the current User's notifications with an allow-listed Logistics type; never accept recipient or tenant IDs as authority.
- Validate source organization/hub ownership before returning identifiers or destinations, including legacy pickup payloads.
- Deny other roles, inactive accounts, invalid organizations, foreign notification UUIDs, and cross-hub resource references.
- Return scoped `404` for inaccessible notification IDs without revealing their existence.
- Subscription billing/enforcement remains deferred; this feature must not introduce a subscription gate.

### MVP producers and dependencies

| Type                                    | Committed trigger and recipient                                     | Boundary                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `logistics-pickup.requested`            | Seller pickup request; selected dispatch operation account                   | Implemented; safe projection and deduplication |
| `logistics-courier.application-pending` | New pending Courier affiliation; associated authorized Admin dispatch account       | Implemented |
| `logistics-task.offer-rejected`         | Final-mile offer rejected; task's owning authorized Admin dispatch account          | Implemented; deduplicate by offer |
| `logistics-evidence.submitted`          | New hub-pickup or delivery-proof evidence; owning authorized Admin dispatch account | Implemented; deduplicate by evidence/purpose |
| `logistics-completion.requested`        | New Courier completion intent; owning authorized Admin dispatch account             | Implemented; deduplicate by intent |
| `logistics-courier.vehicle-updated`      | Committed vehicle field or independent OR/CR replacement; associated authorized Admin dispatch account | Implemented; deduplicate by vehicle revision/recipient; informational, no approval action |

- Do not emit an alert on list reads, QR resolution alone, duplicate retries, or uncommitted source actions.
- First-mile direct pickup remains its current contract; do not require Logistics review merely to create notifications.
- Stale-task timers, first-mile rejection, generic login/security alerts, and other producer types remain separate extensions.
- Re-offering the same task may later produce another rejection alert only for a new committed offer.
- Evidence and completion alerts may both exist: they represent distinct review steps, not duplicate events.
- Existing pickup, approval, and operations queues remain usable if notification delivery fails.
- Vehicle-change notifications contain Courier/vehicle references, changed field names and time only; no evidence, full plates, or private old/new values. Retried delivery never reruns the edit, no-op saves do not notify, and failure cannot reset approval or undo saved information.
- The backend validates current Courier affiliation within this LuboSmart dispatch operation and sole hub before returning `destination: /couriers/{courierId}/vehicle`. A missing/foreign affiliation yields a null destination; the vehicle endpoint independently reauthorizes on navigation.

### Persistence, delivery, and history

- Reuse Laravel `notifications` and `User::notifications()`; do not create a second inbox table by default.
- Preserve existing rows and `read_at`; support legacy pickup payloads through a safe Resource adapter.
- Persist a durable source-event/recipient/type intent or equivalent recoverable event reference with the business transaction.
- Deliver notification work after commit; retry a failed delivery without rerunning pickup, approval, evidence, or fulfillment actions.
- Use database-enforced deduplication or a deterministic notification UUID for `(source event, recipient, type)`.
- Queue uniqueness alone is insufficient; concurrent workers must not create duplicate inbox entries.
- A rolled-back source transaction must not produce an inbox entry. External delivery failure cannot reverse a committed decision.
- Preserve event time separately from delivery attempts; reading never changes source history, custody, stock, assignment, or approval.
- Read-one is idempotent and preserves the first successful `read_at` under concurrent requests.
- Retain inbox history in MVP; deletion, retention cleanup, and archive policies are deferred.

### Safe presentation

- Return UUID `id`, stable `type`, plain-text `title`/`summary`, nullable `read_at`, UTC `created_at`, resource reference, and nullable internal `destination`.
- Use bounded summaries; omit addresses, phone numbers, QR tokens, evidence bytes, raw storage paths, reviewer notes, and payment/auth secrets.
- Construct destinations from known Logistics routes and validated resource IDs, never arbitrary payload URLs.
- Opening an alert does not approve an application, accept work, validate evidence, or change parcel status.
- Fetch authoritative details from the owning feature before any operational action; old alerts are not current-state authority.
- If a target is removed or no longer available, preserve the safe historical alert and show an unavailable destination.
- Unknown/unapproved types are excluded; malformed legacy payloads must not break the entire inbox or leak raw JSON.

## HOW

### API contract — implemented

| Method/path | Request | Success |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/logistics/notifications` | `status=all\|unread\|read`, `page>=1`, `per_page=1..50` | `200`, paginated `data`, Laravel `links`/`meta` |
| `GET /api/v1/logistics/notifications/unread-count` | No body | `200 {data: {unread_count: 3}}` |
| `GET /api/v1/logistics/notifications/{notification}` | UUID, no body | `200 {data: <notification>}`; no read mutation |
| `POST /api/v1/logistics/notifications/{notification}/read` | Empty JSON body | `200 {data: <notification>}` with committed `read_at` |

- Register `unread-count` before the UUID route. Reject unsupported query/body fields with `422`.
- Default list is `status=all`, page 1, 20 rows, ordered by `created_at DESC, id DESC` like Seller/Buyer.
- Unread count uses the identical recipient/type/tenant predicates, independent of current list filters or page size.
- Polling may observe newer counts than an earlier page; refetch after read success rather than assuming independent requests share a snapshot.
- Apply `Cache-Control: private, no-store` to all responses. Reads are safely retryable; read-one requires no client idempotency key.
- Handle `401`, role/account `403`, `403 POLICY_CONSENT_REQUIRED`, scoped `404`, validation `422`, throttling `429`, and retryable server/network failures.
- Use existing auth/error envelopes and `Retry-After` when supplied; never render failures as a successful empty list or zero badge.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "notification-uuid",
    "type": "logistics-pickup.requested",
    "title": "New pickup request",
    "summary": "A Seller requested pickup for 2 Orders.",
    "read_at": null,
    "created_at": "2026-09-13T02:00:00Z",
    "resource_type": "pickup_request",
    "resource_id": "pickup-uuid",
    "destination": null
  }
}
```

### Admin Dispatch Operations UI

- Existing bell, `/notifications`, and `/notifications/:notificationId` remain the entry point. A vehicle alert opens its notification detail, whose destination link navigates to the protected `/couriers/:courierId/vehicle` page.
- The Logistics **Vehicles** sidebar list is another path to current vehicle details; it does not depend on an alert or change notification read state.
- Label that action **Open Courier vehicle** for this alert type. The vehicle page must fetch the current scoped Logistics vehicle API; do not render OR/CR from notification payload or imply the alert contains a historical vehicle snapshot.
- If the backend supplies no destination, the notification remains readable and shows an unavailable target. Direct URL refresh and browser back navigation use the protected Logistics route.
- A vehicle `404`, lost affiliation, or unavailable document leaves the alert readable and shows a safe unavailable/retry state on the destination. Opening a record does not automatically mark the alert read or reapprove the Courier.
- Bell preview requests five recent rows and unread count; the full page uses the same API with read/unread filters.
- Show loading, empty, filtered-empty, loaded, unavailable-target, permission, consent, timeout, offline, and retry states.
- Mark read only through an explicit action or after successful detail rendering; loading the bell/list never marks read.
- Disable duplicate read taps, reconcile server results, and retain unread state when a request fails.
- Refresh on opening/focus and every 30 seconds while visible and authenticated; stop polling on hidden tabs, logout, and authorization loss.
- Clear private cached state on account switch/logout. No persistent offline inbox or background mutation queue.
- Read `Documentation/design.md` before implementation; reuse compatible shared UI primitives, accessible buttons, focus behavior, text status, and restrained live announcements.

### Implementation and verification

- Reuse the implemented Logistics notification service, controller, resource, and route projection. The vehicle destination page belongs to `Documentation/features/logistics/vehicle-fleet-management/specs.md`.
- Test that vehicle notifications supply only a scoped internal destination, and that navigation resolves the current read-only vehicle page without leaking a foreign Courier or private document.
- Keep release-level checks open until the recorded verification gates are complete; this feature adds no email behavior or second inbox table.
- [x] Guest, wrong-role, inactive, cross-account, cross-organization, and forged-resource access fails closed.
- [x] Existing pickup notifications render safely and preserve read history; implemented producers reach only their owning authorized Admin dispatch account.
- [x] List/count/detail share scope, stable ordering, bounded pagination, and private cache rules.
- [x] Concurrent-safe mark-read and deterministic delivery paths preserve first read time and one notification per event/recipient/type; focused API coverage exercises idempotent reads and delivery deduplication.
- [x] Rollback-safe after-commit delivery and queue retries cannot duplicate or undo operational decisions; MySQL/concurrency verification remains a release gate.
- [x] Bell/list/detail implement loading, failures, consent recovery, stale links, explicit read state, polling visibility, and logout cleanup; browser automation remains a release gate.
- [ ] MySQL/MySQL migration/API tests and Logistics type-check/build/UI tests pass with recorded results.
- [x] Vehicle/OR/CR edits notify only the associated authorized Admin dispatch account once per changed revision without reapproval; backend projects a scoped vehicle destination.
- [x] The Logistics notification detail opens the read-only Courier vehicle page; missing/foreign vehicles and documents show truthful unavailable states, and opening the page does not mark the notification read. Browser interaction automation remains a separate verification gate.

### Hub-routing API integration (2026-09-18)

For routed Shipments, final-mile evidence and completion producers resolve the recipient and resource destination through current custody organization/hub. Origin provider fields remain immutable; they no longer authorize another hub's final-mile task or proof. Historical notifications preserve their safe text while unavailable/foreign task destinations return no operational context. Transfer events remain custody history and do not add an unapproved notification type.
