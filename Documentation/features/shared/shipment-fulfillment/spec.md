> **Cross-document decision notice:** This document is the canonical decision and reconciliation record for shared Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask concerns; it is not a replacement for the implementation contracts in `Documentation/requirements.md`, `Documentation/workspace.md`, `Documentation/schema.md`, the domain documents, or owning feature specifications. Use it to answer cross-role concerns and direct revisions to those files. A checked decision is the accepted cross-role rule for those revisions; copy its wording and rationale into the owning canonical documents before implementation. This guide does not itself create a route, migration, or working endpoint. If existing documents or code disagree with a checked decision, reconcile the disagreement explicitly instead of silently choosing one.

# Shipment and Fulfillment Lifecycle (Decision and Revision Guide)

## Final-mile parcel context revision (2026-09-21)

Final-mile Courier hub handoff is task-bound: the accepted Delivery Task and expected revision identify the parcel server-side, and Logistics confirms pending handoff evidence before custody changes. Courier final-mile requests no longer carry QR/tracking/Order identifiers; first-mile Seller pickup and Logistics physical parcel scans retain their own identifier rules. The Courier may read the Order merchandise subtotal as `parcel.price` with currency for the assigned delivery. The Courier's drop-off proof remains a private photo POD followed by Delivered intent and Logistics confirmation. Historical final-mile identifier wording below is superseded by the owning feature contracts.

## Final-mile handoff revision (2026-09-20)

Admin dispatch operations dispatch at most 15 sorted destination-hub parcels to one Courier schedule, and the Courier accepts that whole schedule atomically. Underlying Shipment, Parcel, Delivery Task, offer, and Order records stay separate. Courier final-mile delivery uses private photo POD, a separate **Delivered** intent, and Logistics confirmation; a failed delivery attempt records a reason without changing `out_for_delivery`, so the Courier may retry later. Advisory Geoapify Matrix/Routing results and MapLibre display apply only to that final-mile schedule. Linehaul manifests, transfers, and custody remain independent. Historical QR-delivery and route-deferred statements below are superseded by the owning 2026-09-20 feature revisions.

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Keep a compact reference for the future movement of a prepared Order from Seller pickup through the Logistics hub to Buyer delivery.
- **Why it exists:** Current Order, waybill, pickup, Logistics, and Courier documents mention the same physical flow in different places. This guide collects terminology, records cross-role decisions, and identifies exactly which documents must be revised together.
- **Current baseline:** Seller pickup requests, selected LuboSmart dispatch operations, shared waybills, pickup schedules, first-mile assignment/acceptance/confirmation, route manifests, shared Parcel/Shipment records, hub processing, atomic final-mile dispatch-batch acceptance, QR/reference hub pickup, private photo POD, and Logistics-gated delivery completion exist. Waybills expose an explicit tracking ID with a thin Code 128 barcode, and Logistics sort plans route exact Buyer postal codes at scan time. Signature proof, live location telemetry, returns, and exceptional recovery remain deferred; advisory Geoapify final-mile routing is implemented.
- **Role boundary:** Seller prepares and hands off; Logistics operates its single hub and assigns first-mile/final-mile work; Courier acts only on an assigned mobile API task; Buyer reads safe tracking projections.
- **Non-goals:** changing current routes or migrations, adding a second waybill, choosing a map provider, optimizing routes, creating multi-hub operations, billing subscriptions, or building Courier web UI.

```text
Buyer places Order
→ Seller processes and confirms ready_for_pickup
→ selected dispatch operation creates/offers first-mile task
→ first-mile Courier accepts and picks up from Seller
→ Admin dispatch operations receive, sorts, transfers, and dispatches from its sole hub
→ Admin dispatch operations create/offers final-mile task
→ final-mile Courier accepts, picks up from hub, and delivers
→ Buyer receives safe status/proof projection
```

## MUST (revision rules)

### Revision authority and propagation

- Read this guide before revising any listed shared order, shipment, fulfillment, Logistics, Courier, Seller, or Buyer document; it is canonical for cross-role shipment/fulfillment decisions, while `Documentation/requirements.md`, `Documentation/workspace.md`, and `Documentation/schema.md` remain canonical for role obligations, lifecycle presentation, and database implementation details respectively.
- Treat each checked decision as the cross-document rule to propagate into `Documentation/requirements.md`, `Documentation/workspace.md`, `Documentation/schema.md`, affected domains, and owning feature specifications.
- Keep the copied rule, terminology, ownership, status mapping, and rationale consistent across every affected document; do not leave a stale conflicting statement behind.
- A checked decision may require additive migrations, API changes, tests, or UI-spec revisions, but those changes must still be explicitly implemented in their owning files.
- No endpoint listed or described here becomes available merely because it appears here; its owning specification must document the method, path, authorization, payloads, responses, errors, retries, and implementation status.
- If code or a previously edited document disagrees with a checked decision, pause the implementation and reconcile the guide, canonical documents, and server behavior before proceeding.

### Decision record and canonical handoff

- [x] This guide is the shared decision record for Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask questions; “approved elsewhere” no longer means an unnamed document, and accepted rules go to `Documentation/schema.md` for records/constraints, `Documentation/workspace.md` for lifecycle, `Documentation/requirements.md` for role obligations, and domain/spec files for ownership and endpoints.
- [x] Once propagated, an accepted decision supersedes stale wording in each affected document; the guide remains the traceable rationale for that revision.
- [x] Existing scope includes Seller pickup requests, selected-provider context, shared waybills, schedules, first-mile assignment/acceptance/confirmation, Inventory fulfillment, and route manifests.
- [x] Shared Shipment/Parcel custody, hub processing, final-mile tasks, QR evidence, and Logistics-validated P0 delivery completion are implemented through the additive migration and transition service; advanced proof/location/return policies remain separately gated.
- [x] Each LuboSmart dispatch operation owns exactly one operational hub; no sub-hub or multi-hub branch is introduced by this worksheet.
- [x] First-mile and final-mile are separate task legs. Admin dispatch operations own creation/assignment; a Courier only accepts and acts on its own offer. The same or another eligible Courier may perform the second leg.
- [x] For the MVP, one DeliveryTask represents one Order/Parcel. A pickup schedule may group many Orders, but it does not merge their tasks, waybills, snapshots, or histories.
- [x] The existing high-level OrderStatus remains separate from detailed physical Shipment/DeliveryTask states; no source-only or uppercase label may be persisted as a new Order status.
- [x] Physical scan actors/evidence, failed-delivery/reassignment/expiration, return/refund, and partial-fulfillment decisions are recorded below; implementation questions remain in the readiness worksheet and every future operational endpoint still needs an owning feature specification before React, web, or Logistics UI can consume it.

### Reconciliation register

In this register, `[x]` records an accepted decision or completed named correction. The sign-off checklist separately verifies propagation. Implementation and rollout require their own evidence. Do not expose an operational capability until its owning contract, migration, authorization checks, and verification evidence are present.

- [x] **Logistics-selection authority:** The Seller selects one eligible LuboSmart dispatch operation when committing the pickup request. Checkout remains provider-neutral; the Buyer selects a shipping address, not a Logistics provider. Remove or rewrite the old Buyer-selection wording in `Documentation/requirements.md` and `Documentation/workspace.md`.
- [x] **High-level status mapping:** `picked_up` is the high-level projection of first-mile `picked_up_from_seller`; `assigned` is the Buyer-facing projection of a committed dispatch schedule/final-mile Courier offer. Hub receipt and sorting remain detailed physical milestones, not meanings of either high-level value.
- [x] **Implemented/deferred summaries:** Update `Documentation/domains/Seller.md`, `Documentation/domains/Buyer.md`, and `Documentation/features/seller/prepare-orders/spec.md` so Seller pickup selection, shared-waybill persistence, pickup scheduling, first-mile assignment/acceptance, and explicit pickup confirmation are identified as the implemented foundation. The shared physical Shipment/Parcel bridge, hub operations, final-mile tasks, QR hub evidence, photo POD, and P0 delivery completion are now implemented; signature media, location telemetry, and exceptional recovery remain deferred.
- [x] **Schema-ledger synchronization:** Reconcile `Documentation/schema.md` with the migration directory without renaming or editing executed migrations. Add the implemented low-stock-alert, wishlist, and Logistics profile-photo migrations that are missing from the ledger; correct its duplicate sequence numbers for the Courier pickup, Product Q&A, and route-manifest entries; and record the implemented policy-consent protected-action gate.
- [x] **Endpoint ownership paths:** The ownership table below uses the exact existing `spec.md`/`specs.md` paths. A route is usable only when that owning specification marks it implemented and the additive schema is deployed; advanced conceptual capabilities remain unavailable until their own rollout gates pass.
- [x] **Legacy-reference audit:** Active canonical documents must not rely on the missing `app.md` or `Documentation/workflows.md`, old uppercase order values, or Mapbox assumptions. Draft and superseded specs may retain historical wording, but they must not be used as implementation authority until revised.
- [x] **Shared-policy ledger wording:** Update the deferred-schema table so implemented policy status/acceptance APIs and protected-action enforcement are not described as wholly deferred; login/session bootstrap remains reachable for consent completion.

### Cross-document decisions: ownership boundaries

- Buyer checkout creates the high-level Order at `placed` for the current COD flow and stores an immutable destination snapshot.
- Seller owns `placed → seller_processing → ready_for_pickup`, selects one eligible LuboSmart dispatch operation, and commits the shared waybill and readiness transaction.
- The selected LuboSmart dispatch operation owns pickup scheduling, first-mile task creation/offer, sole-hub receipt, sorting, transfer, dispatch, and final-mile assignment.
- A Courier can accept only a task offered by its associated active LuboSmart dispatch operation. Courier assignment authority remains with Logistics.
- First-mile and final-mile assignments are independent. Completing first-mile pickup does not grant or require final-mile assignment; the same or a different eligible Courier may perform the later leg.
- Buyer actions are read-only against fulfillment state. Buyer tracking must not expose private Courier, Seller, Logistics, address, evidence, or internal scan data.

### Cross-document decisions: record vocabulary

- Operational records include `Shipment`, `Parcel`, `DeliveryTask`, assignment offers, physical evidence, custody events, and P0 proof-of-delivery records; advanced media/location/return records remain future extensions.
- The Seller-created shared waybill is created in the pickup-request transaction at `ready_for_pickup`; it is not replaced by a second Logistics waybill at hub receipt.
- The shared waybill and its Order/Parcel reference are immutable; later route, assignment, print, and scan activity is append-only history.
- The shared waybill's human reference is the immutable `tracking_id`; its primary physical barcode is a thin 1D Code 128 encoding of that value, while QR remains a compatibility/fallback identifier.
- Seller pickup may snapshot the Buyer postal code and the selected dispatch operation hub's current sort-plan match as a routing hint. Automatic Sorting resolves the tenant-owned tracking ID and rechecks the current active plan server-side; missing plan, postal code, mapping, or lane falls back to the exception lane without changing received custody.
- For the MVP, one `DeliveryTask` represents one Order/Parcel; a pickup schedule may group Orders operationally but never merges their tasks, waybills, snapshots, or histories.
- The Logistics registration address represents its one operational hub. Sub-hubs and additional hub records are outside the MVP reference boundary.

### Cross-document decisions: physical vocabulary

- Use lowercase `snake_case` for any future persisted/API values and keep enum-like database columns string-backed with PHP enum casts.
- The detailed physical sequence described by the current canonical docs is:

```text
awaiting_seller_pickup
→ seller_pickup_assigned
→ seller_pickup_accepted
→ picked_up_from_seller
→ received_at_hub
→ sorted_at_hub
→ dispatched_from_hub
→ delivery_assigned
→ delivery_accepted
→ picked_up_from_hub
→ in_transit
→ out_for_delivery
→ delivered
```

- These detailed values belong to the deployed Shipment/Delivery Task contract; they remain separate from `orders.status` and are stored as string-backed enum-like columns.
- Existing high-level `OrderStatus` compatibility values remain separate. `picked_up` projects the explicit first-mile Seller handoff; `assigned` projects the committed scheduled final-mile assignment and does not represent hub receipt. Hub receipt, sorting, and dispatch remain detailed milestones; internal transfer execution remains deferred.
- Automatic Sorting records the plan revision, postal-code match, selected lane, or exception reason on the scan result. Client predictions and manual lane choices are inputs only; tenant/hub ownership and the current plan are authoritative.
- Task-level `rejected` and informational `stale` outcomes follow the exception decision below and do not write a new `orders.status` value. Buyer cancellation and Seller rejection of eligible `placed` Orders are implemented. Post-pickup cancellation, `delivery_failed`, `return_requested`, and `returned` transitions remain deferred.

### Cross-document decisions: inventory and payment boundary

- Placement reserves the requested SKU quantities atomically for the Order.
- An accepted cancellation or rejection before `picked_up_from_seller` releases only that Order's reservation once and transactionally.
- `picked_up_from_seller` is the approved fulfillment boundary for consuming the reservation once; it must not decrement `on_hand` twice.
- Post-pickup cancellation, terminal delivery failure, returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment remain deferred until an approved policy and line-level records exist. Retryable failed doorstep attempts keep the task `out_for_delivery`.
- Waybill creation, printing, scanning, scheduling, and assignment do not independently mutate payment, Inventory, or Order status.

### Current implementation versus accepted target

**Current/future boundary:** `ConfirmFirstMilePickup` remains the compatibility writer for the existing first-mile Seller handoff and Inventory fulfillment. It now idempotently bridges that result into the shared Parcel/Shipment/DeliveryTask records without replaying stock. The new final-mile and hub transitions use `FulfillmentTransitionService`, Logistics validation, and append-only physical events; photo/signature evidence, location telemetry, and exceptional recovery remain future extensions.

### Cross-document decisions: API and client boundary

- The current Seller pickup, Logistics scheduling, and first-mile Courier API contracts remain owned by their existing feature specifications.
- Waybill and sorting contracts share `tracking_id` as the scan identity; downstream Logistics projections should expose it alongside the backwards-compatible waybill `reference` alias.
- Future physical transitions must use one server-owned transition service that validates the current state, tenant/hub ownership, actor authority, evidence, idempotency, and immutable history.
- Courier remains mobile-only and external to this repository. A React client may consume an explicitly implemented API contract but must not infer transitions from this reference file.
- An authorized Courier may view the operational Order, parcel, waybill, pickup, destination, item, and delivery-instruction data needed for its offered or accepted task, plus provider-neutral `distance_km` and `estimated_duration_minutes`. Secrets, private evidence, raw storage paths, and unrelated personal data remain excluded.
- Route optimization, distance calculations, map rendering, and provider credentials are separate concerns. No mapbox or other provider dependency is implied here.

### Cross-document decisions: safety rules

- Every query and mutation must derive tenant, Shop, LuboSmart dispatch operation, sole hub, and Courier affiliation from authenticated server state.
- Retried transitions return the canonical committed projection and do not duplicate tasks, scans, custody events, Inventory effects, or notifications.
- Concurrent transitions lock or otherwise compare the current state and return a conflict without overwriting newer history.
- State changes commit before after-commit notifications or other communication. Delivery failure must not reverse a committed fulfillment decision.
- Public/buyer projections are safe, minimal, and separately cached from user-specific task or consent data.

### Sign-off checklist (worksheet status)

- [x] Shared schema scope, one Order/Parcel per MVP task, one hub, and detailed-state separation are recorded in this worksheet.
- [x] First-mile/final-mile ownership and independent assignment rules are recorded in this worksheet.
- [x] Current inventory reservation boundary and the existing waybill/schedule/first-mile implementation boundary are recorded.
- [x] Tracking-ID Code 128 identity, pickup-time sort-plan hints, and server-authoritative scan-time postal-code routing with exception fallback are recorded for the owning waybill, pickup, and sorting specifications.
- [x] The endpoint-ownership rule is recorded; each eventual endpoint still requires an owning feature specification with method, path, auth, request, response, errors, and retry semantics.
- [x] Provider-selection wording is consistent: Seller selection at pickup request is stated everywhere, and the stale Buyer checkout-selection wording is removed.
- [x] High-level `picked_up`/`assigned` mapping is consistent everywhere: first-mile confirmation versus committed scheduled final-mile assignment.
- [x] Seller/Buyer domain summaries and Seller Prepare Orders distinguish the implemented pickup/waybill/scheduling/first-mile foundation and deployed P0 final-mile operations from deferred media/location/exceptional operations.
- [x] `Documentation/schema.md` migration ledger includes every repository migration, uses unique documentation sequence numbers, and records the implemented policy-consent protected-action gate.
- [ ] Complete propagation of detailed schema columns/constraints, per-transition evidence/side effects, endpoint payloads, and the first-mile compatibility rollout into all owning specs. The selection, status, implementation summaries, migration-ledger corrections, and shared migration plan are documented; this broader implementation gate remains open.

### MVP re-offer, expiry, and internal transfer rules

- A Courier rejects only its currently offered, unaccepted assignment. Record rejection reason, actor, and UTC timestamp; leave the Order, Shipment custody, reservation, and physical milestones unchanged.
- Logistics re-offers the same task by appending a new offer for another eligible affiliated Courier. The task returns to `seller_pickup_assigned` for first mile or `delivery_assigned` for final mile; the rejected offer remains immutable.
- Lock the task and current offer together. Acceptance/rejection/re-offer races allow only one compatible commit; conflicting requests receive `409`. Matching retries return the original committed result.
- Automatic offer expiry and timed reassignment are deferred. MVP offers have no expiry deadline; unfinished tasks are not automatically cancelled or reassigned. A stale indicator is advisory and cannot authorize mutations.
- `in_transfer` execution is deferred in the one-hub MVP. Use `received_at_hub → sorted_at_hub → dispatched_from_hub`; dispatch requires a recorded sorting event. Do not create a dummy transfer event or an additional hub. The reserved `in_transfer` name is unavailable until a separately approved internal-transfer feature exists.

### First-mile migration bridge (implemented compatibility behavior)

The dependency-ordered table/constraint design and shared service ownership are deployed in `Documentation/schema.md`, section 14. Existing first-mile confirmation remains backward compatible while authorized confirmation or Logistics lookup lazily creates the shared records. MySQL migration and end-to-end API coverage pass; MySQL verification remains environment-dependent until the local container credentials are reconciled. Courier Complete Delivery, Delivery History, and Logistics Update Status now consume the implemented P0 QR final-mile contract; media/location/exception extensions remain unchecked.

1. The additive operational tables and one-to-one mapping from each legacy `first_mile_tasks.id` to the new DeliveryTask UUID are deployed. Legacy tables, IDs, enum values, QR hashes, waybill snapshots, and idempotency results remain intact.
2. A Parcel and Shipment are created lazily per authorized waybill/first-mile confirmation, without changing Order status or Inventory. Unique Order/waybill and legacy-task links make reruns safe.
3. For an existing `courier_pickup_confirmations` row, import an immutable custody event with its original Courier, pickup time, correlation ID, and a unique source-confirmation reference. Mark its provenance `legacy_confirmation`; do not fabricate a Logistics validator or validation timestamp.
4. Reconcile the imported pickup with its existing Order status event and Inventory fulfillment movements. Existing movement keys use `courier-pickup-{legacy_task_id}-{inventory_balance_id}`. Link these exact effects; importing history never calls `FulfillOrderReservation`.
5. Missing/contradictory confirmations, status events, quantities, or movements fail the migration verification for that Order. Report them for repair; do not invent evidence, reset balances, or silently mark the import successful.
6. Existing first-mile writes remain on their implemented compatibility path while final-mile operations use the new service; accepted but unpicked tasks map as accepted, with no custody or Inventory effect.
7. The old pickup endpoint preserves exact replay behavior for already-committed keys after normal authorization; each successful confirmation calls the idempotent bridge. Final-mile QR evidence never returns an old-style pickup success for merely pending evidence.
8. Final-mile Courier submissions store QR evidence; only the owning Logistics validation transaction appends hub-pickup/delivery custody, and final delivery projects `orders.status = delivered` once.
9. Use one Order-level fulfillment-effect guard plus per-SKU movement uniqueness across legacy/new task IDs. Lock schedule/task/Order and balances in a consistent documented order; a retry or overlapping legacy/new request must not deduct stock twice.
10. Once new operational writes exist, rollback means disabling those writes while retaining tables/history. Do not reopen the old direct-confirmation writer or destructively roll back custody tables. Resume through a corrected forward deployment.

The bridge implementation must test concurrent confirmation during cutover, resumable backfill, legacy replay, accepted-unpicked tasks, inconsistent legacy records, cross-organization IDs, and unchanged stock/history checksums. Route availability stays disabled until these checks pass on MySQL.

### Remaining technical details

- [x] Define exact Shipment/Parcel foreign keys, uniqueness, nullability, package measurement units/limits (or explicitly defer measurements), and creation/backfill timing in `Documentation/schema.md`.
- [x] Define the compatibility rollout from `first_mile_tasks`/`courier_pickup_confirmations` to shared tasks and Logistics validation without creating duplicate custody or Inventory effects.
- [x] Specify whether `in_transfer` is an internal sole-hub step and when it may be skipped; no inter-hub transfer is authorized.
- [x] Define re-offer transition from rejected state and defer automatic expiry. A concrete stale-display threshold remains owned by the Dashboard contract; until configured, expose the last activity timestamp rather than inventing a stale deadline.
- [x] Complete every transition's preconditions, evidence, transactional effects, retry projection, and conflict response in the owning API contract before exposing it.

### Implementation-readiness worksheet

Complete each unchecked question before creating physical operational migrations. A blank answer is an open contract decision; mark a question `[x]` only after the decision, owner, and affected canonical document are recorded. Keep detailed columns and constraints in `Documentation/schema.md`, lifecycle wording in `Documentation/workspace.md`, and endpoint details in the owning feature specification.

#### Record contract questions

- [x] **Shipment identity and relationship:** Is one Shipment created per Order, per Parcel, or per fulfillment instance? Which immutable Order/Parcel/waybill references and foreign keys are required?  
       **Answer/owner:** Create exactly one Shipment per physical Parcel. Since the MVP has one Parcel per Order, each Order effectively has one Shipment. First-mile and final-mile are separate DeliveryTasks linked to that same Shipment. Courier reassignment, scans, and status changes append history; they do not create another Shipment.

- [x] **Parcel identity and packaging:** What identifies the Parcel? Which dimensions/weight units, item-and-quantity snapshot, and waybill link are stored? Is more than one Parcel per Order allowed in a later version?  
       **Answer/owner:** One Order produces one Parcel, containing all of its items, and one Shipment. The Parcel has a stable ID, package details, an immutable item/quantity snapshot, and one link to the shared waybill. First-mile and final-mile tasks reference this same Parcel; they do not create new Parcels. Multiple Parcels per Order require a future approved schema and waybill decision.

- [x] **Leg:** Confirm that `first_mile` is Seller → the owning Logistics hub and `final_mile` is that hub → Buyer. Identify the field that distinguishes the two legs.  
       **Answer/owner:** Each `DeliveryTask` has a required server-controlled `leg` field with either `first_mile` or `final_mile`.  
       - `first_mile`: Seller → the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation’s sole hub.  
       - `final_mile`: that sole hub → Buyer.

- [x] **Current state:** Should the existing explicit lowercase `snake_case` enum values remain the complete state vocabulary? If any value is added, where is its transition and migration approved?  
       **Answer/owner:** The project/domain owner approves the shared state vocabulary. Keep the existing explicit lowercase `snake_case` enum values. Any new value requires a documented transition in `Documentation/workspace.md`, a string-backed schema/migration change in `Documentation/schema.md`, and an update to its owning feature specification. Implementation is owned by the backend transition-service maintainer.
- [x] **Logistics/hub scope:** Which owning LuboSmart dispatch operation and authorized account(s) may view, create, update, re-offer, or close an assignment? Which fields are protected, and how is cross-organization access denied?  
       **Answer/owner:** Only the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation—the organization with which the assigned Courier is affiliated and that created the task—may access and manage the assignment. Its authorized accounts may view, create, update permitted assignment fields, re-offer, or close it. The LuboSmart dispatch operation, sole hub, Order/Parcel/waybill links, task leg, state transitions, actor data, timestamps, and historical events are server-controlled. Cross-organization access is denied through authenticated organization, hub, role, and Courier-affiliation checks; client-supplied organization IDs are not trusted.
- [x] **Offer/acceptance:** How are offered, accepted, rejected, and re-offered Couriers represented? Confirm that a rejected offer stays in history and the same task may be offered again.  
       **Answer/owner:**
  - **Offered:** Logistics sends the task to a Courier; store the task, Courier, offer time, and expiry/state.
  - **Accepted:** The Courier accepts the offer; the task’s current assignment becomes that Courier.
  - **Rejected:** The Courier declines; store the rejection reason and timestamp. The Order and custody state do not change.
  - **Re-offered:** Logistics offers the same `DeliveryTask` to another Courier by creating a new offer/assignment record. Do not create a new Order, Parcel, or Shipment.

- [x] **Actor timestamps and presentation:** Which server timestamps and performing/validating/recording actors are required? Should a restricted Logistics/Admin audit log be separate from Buyer/Courier milestone timelines?  
       **Answer/owner:**
      All event times are generated by the server in UTC and are immutable. Each event records the relevant actor:
  - `offered_at` and the authorized Admin dispatch account that created the offer.
  - `accepted_at` or `rejected_at`, the Courier, and any rejection reason.
  - `performed_at` and the Courier who physically performed the action.
  - `validated_at` and the authorized Admin dispatch account that validated the scan/evidence.
  - `recorded_at` and the authorized Admin dispatch account that committed the authoritative event.
  - `expires_at` for an offer where an expiry window applies.

  A restricted Logistics/Admin audit log is separate from Buyer and Courier milestone timelines. The same append-only event history may feed both views, but each role receives a different authorized projection. Audit logs may show actors, reasons, evidence references, and validation details; Buyer/Courier timelines show only the safe milestones relevant to them.

- [x] **Idempotency:** What scope makes a mutation key unique (task, action, actor, or request), and what canonical projection must a retry return?  
       **Answer/owner:** Mutation idempotency is scoped to the authenticated actor, owning LuboSmart dispatch operation, `DeliveryTask`, action, and client-provided `Idempotency-Key`. The server stores the request hash and the committed result. Reusing the same key with the same request returns the original canonical projection, including the task state, current assignment, and committed event identifiers. It must not create duplicate assignments, scans, custody events, inventory effects, or notifications. Reusing the key with different request details returns a conflict. A new logical action or re-offer requires a new key; client-supplied actor or organization identifiers are never trusted.
- [x] **Scan/evidence:** What QR/reference and approved evidence does the Courier submit? How is the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation notified, and does the scan only await validation or ever advance custody directly?  
       **Answer/owner:** The Courier scans the opaque waybill QR in the React app. The backend validates that it belongs to the Courier’s accepted task and owning LuboSmart dispatch operation, then stores an immutable scan event with the server timestamp, Courier, task leg, and idempotency key. The owning LuboSmart dispatch operation receives an after-commit in-app/dashboard notification. The scan is treated as Courier-submitted evidence pending Logistics validation; it does not independently advance custody. After validation, the shared transition service records the applicable pickup state.
- [x] **Append-only history:** Which assignment, scan, evidence, custody, and re-offer events are immutable? Can a current assignment be closed without deleting its history?  
       **Answer/owner:** Assignment offers, acceptances, rejections, expirations, re-offers, scan submissions, evidence decisions, custody transitions, actor details, timestamps, reasons, and idempotency results are immutable after commit. A current assignment may be closed only through an authorized state transition; closing it updates the current projection and appends a close event without deleting or rewriting prior history. Re-offering creates a new offer record for the same `DeliveryTask`, while the previous offer remains unchanged. Any correction is recorded as a new event rather than editing an old event.

#### Transition and implementation questions

- [x] **Transition matrix:** For every allowed `from → to` state, record actor, preconditions/evidence, transaction side effects, retry result, and concurrent-conflict result in `Documentation/workspace.md` and the owning specs.  
       **Answer/owner:** The authoritative transition matrix is maintained in `Documentation/workspace.md` and mirrored in each owning feature specification. The following is the accepted target vocabulary, not a claim that every state exists in today's backend enums. Existing first-mile task `assigned`/`accepted` values remain distinct from the future `seller_pickup_assigned`/`seller_pickup_accepted` names and high-level Order `assigned`. No client may submit an arbitrary target status.
  - `awaiting_seller_pickup → seller_pickup_assigned`: Admin dispatch operations create/offers the task after Seller readiness, selected-provider, hub, and waybill checks.
  - `seller_pickup_assigned → seller_pickup_accepted`: The affiliated Courier accepts its own offer.
  - `seller_pickup_assigned → rejected`: The Courier rejects the offer with a reason; the Order and custody state remain unchanged. Admin dispatch operations may re-offer the same task.
  - `seller_pickup_accepted → picked_up_from_seller`: The Courier scans/submits the waybill evidence; Admin dispatch operations validate it and the transition service commits the first-mile handoff and approved inventory effect once.
  - `picked_up_from_seller → received_at_hub`: Admin dispatch operations validate receipt at its sole hub.
  - `received_at_hub → sorted_at_hub`: dedicated Receiving and Hub operations record these sole-hub transitions.
  - `sorted_at_hub → dispatched_from_hub → delivery_assigned`: one dispatch schedule atomically assigns one Courier to 1–15 parcels while retaining a task/offer per parcel.
  - `delivery_assigned → delivery_accepted`: The assigned affiliated Courier accepts the offer.
  - `delivery_accepted → picked_up_from_hub`: The Courier scans/submits handoff evidence; Admin dispatch operations validate and records the hub pickup.
  - `picked_up_from_hub → in_transit → out_for_delivery`: The final-mile Courier performs the movement.
  - `out_for_delivery → delivered`: The Courier submits proof; Admin dispatch operations validate the evidence, and the owning Complete Delivery transition commits `delivered`.

  Every accepted transition appends immutable history, uses server-side authorization and idempotency, returns the committed projection on retry, and returns a conflict without
  overwriting newer history when concurrent state is detected. Post-pickup cancellation, delivery failure, returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment remain unavailable until separately
  approved.

- [x] **Failure and cancellation boundary:** Which pre-`picked_up_from_seller` cancellation is implemented now? Confirm that post-pickup cancellation, delivery failure, returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment remain deferred until separately approved.  
       **Answer/owner:** In the MVP, Buyer cancellation and Seller rejection are allowed only while the Order is `placed`, before `picked_up_from_seller`. Each releases only that Order’s reserved SKU quantities once and transactionally. A Courier’s task rejection is assignment-level and does not cancel the Order. After `picked_up_from_seller`, automatic cancellation or inventory release is unavailable. A retryable failed doorstep attempt preserves `out_for_delivery`; terminal delivery failure, returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment remain deferred until their policies, line-level records, and owning transitions are separately approved.
- [x] **Migration order and rollout gate:** What additive table, foreign-key, and index order is required, and what prevents unavailable endpoints from being enabled before the schema is deployed?  
       **Answer/owner:** The additive `2026_09_12_000001_create_fulfillment_operations.php` migration creates Parcel, Shipment, DeliveryTask, offer history, evidence, completion intents, and append-only events in dependency order, with UUID keys, indexes, and uniqueness constraints. Existing migrations are unchanged and enum-like values remain string-backed. Deployed P0 routes are usable only after this schema is applied; unsupported advanced routes remain disabled and fail closed. React, web, and Logistics clients may consume only routes explicitly marked implemented.
- [x] **Transition-service owner:** Which server service owns state validation, tenant/hub/role checks, locking or revision checks, idempotency, append-only history, and after-commit notifications?  
       **Answer/owner:** Current high-level Order transitions remain owned by `app/Services/OrderTransitionService.php`; deployed physical Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask transitions are owned by `app/Services/Fulfillment/FulfillmentTransitionService.php`. The fulfillment service validates the transition matrix, organization/sole-hub/role/Courier affiliation, evidence, row locks or revisions, idempotency, and append-only history in one transaction. It applies only the approved final-mile projection and dispatches notifications after commit. Logistics remains the authoritative business recorder for Courier-submitted scans and evidence, but the transition service commits the state. Controllers and clients may submit requests only; they cannot set statuses directly. Unsupported advanced schema/capabilities remain unavailable and fail closed.
- [x] **Endpoint ownership:** Which feature specification owns each scan, hub operation, final-mile task, and proof-of-delivery endpoint, and is each route implemented or unavailable?  
       **Answer/owner:** Each operational endpoint has one owning feature specification. The owning specification defines its method, path, authorization, request, response, errors, retry behavior, and implementation status. Supporting specifications may reference the contract but must not redefine it.

| Endpoint area                                                 | Owning specification                                      | Status                                                                              |

- [x] **Verification plan approved:** The test categories below are the accepted plan; this checkbox does not claim that future physical migrations or tests have run.
- [ ] **Verification execution:** MySQL physical migration and end-to-end API tests pass; MySQL schema-health/API verification is still pending the local container credential fix and is recorded in `Documentation/PROGRESS.md`.

  **Answer/owner:** The backend fulfillment maintainer owns the verification plan. The migration and API suites must run against both the PHPUnit MySQL database and MySQL, which is the production database. MySQL coverage is now present and passing for the final-mile flow; MySQL execution remains an environment prerequisite before production rollout.
  - **Migration tests:** Verify migration order, Shipment/Parcel/DeliveryTask foreign keys, indexes, uniqueness constraints, string-backed status fields, sole-hub scope, append-only
    history constraints, and schema-health checks on MySQL.
  - **IDOR/tenant tests:** A Courier, authorized Admin dispatch account, Seller, or Buyer cannot read or mutate another organization’s task, hub, Order, Parcel, waybill, scan, evidence, or history.
  - **Invalid-sequence tests:** Reject transitions with the wrong current state, leg, actor, assignment, missing evidence, or invalid precondition without changing state.
  - **Retry/idempotency tests:** Retrying the same mutation key returns the original committed projection and does not duplicate assignments, history, inventory effects, or
    notifications. Reusing a key with different input returns a conflict.
  - **Concurrency tests:** Simultaneous transitions use locking or revision checks; only one valid transition commits and the other receives a conflict without overwriting history.
  - **Evidence-authority tests:** Couriers may submit scans/evidence only for their assigned task. Admin dispatch operations validate and records the authoritative event; a QR scan or notification
    alone cannot advance custody.
  - **Inventory-boundary tests:** Cancellation or rejection before `picked_up_from_seller` releases the reservation once; pickup fulfillment commits it once; post-pickup cancellation,
    returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment have no unapproved automatic inventory effect.
  - **Notification-failure tests:** A notification or queue failure after commit does not roll back the transition, inventory effect, or audit history. Retrying delivery does not create
    duplicate notifications.
  - **Rollout gate:** MySQL tests pass for the deployed P0 flow. MySQL schema-health and API checks must still pass before production rollout; clients may consume only the explicitly implemented routes in development environments with the migration applied.

## HOW

- If implementation is explicitly requested, first read the current canonical requirements, workspace, schema, domain, and owning feature specs. Do not start from this file alone.
- Complete the unchecked readiness questions above, record the rationale here, and propagate accepted rules into every affected canonical document before writing code. Keep those edits explicit and reviewable; do not leave a checked decision only in this guide.
- Add only additive migrations for approved Shipment, Parcel, DeliveryTask, assignment, Scan, custody, and proof records. Never edit an executed migration or add native MySQL enum columns.
- Implement transitions through a shared service with transactions, row locks/optimistic revisions, server-derived ownership, idempotency keys, and append-only history.
- Persist immutable audit events and durable notification/outbox work in the state transaction; dispatch external delivery after commit so provider failures cannot roll back state.
- Keep Buyer projections read-only and role-specific; keep Logistics UI in its dashboard and Courier UI in the external React project.
- Test every approved transition on MySQL, including IDOR, stale/concurrent requests, retries, invalid sequence, tenant isolation, inventory boundaries, and notification failure.
- Roll out schema and transition contracts before enabling physical custody actions; do not expose a conceptual endpoint as working API.

### Recorded cross-document decisions and deferred outcomes

- Lane-aware staging/dispatch is implemented under `Documentation/features/orders/lane-aware-dispatch/spec.md`: durable Shipment lane/session assignments, receipt-time ordering, audited pre-dispatch moves, explicit mixed-lane batches, immutable membership provenance, and live-lane clearing at validated hub pickup. Session closure reconciles sorting rather than gating each ready parcel.
- [x] Task cardinality: one Order/Parcel per DeliveryTask; schedules may group Orders but do not create a multi-parcel task.
- [x] Scan/evidence authority: the Courier scans the Order's waybill QR/reference in the app and submits the event/evidence; Admin dispatch operations validate and records the authoritative event, preserving both the performing Courier and recording authorized Admin dispatch account. The QR/reference scan, Courier identity, and timestamp are the minimum evidence.
- [x] Exception policy: returns, refunds, and partial fulfillment are deferred. A rejected Courier offer marks the task `rejected` without changing the Order; Admin dispatch operations may offer the same task to another eligible Courier. An unfinished task becomes informationally `stale` and is not automatically cancelled or reassigned; no automatic post-pickup inventory release is assumed.
- [x] Courier route summary: an authorized Courier may see provider-neutral `distance_km` and `estimated_duration_minutes` with the offered or accepted task; no map vendor or graphical route is implied.
