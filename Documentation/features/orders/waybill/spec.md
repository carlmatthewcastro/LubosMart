# Seller-Created Pickup Waybill

## WHAT

- **Purpose:** Create one printable, scannable waybill for each Order when the Seller commits **Request pickup** with a selected LuboSmart dispatch operation.
- **Actors:** Seller creates, views, downloads, and prints; selected dispatch operation views/downloads; assigned Courier scans through the external mobile API and submits the scan/evidence to Logistics for validation.
- **Ownership change:** This is one shared waybill, created by LuboSmart from Seller-authorized immutable data; it replaces the earlier split between Seller package label and Logistics-created hub waybill.
- **Lifecycle:**
  ```text
  Seller packs parcel → selects Logistics → Request pickup
  → waybill identity/snapshot/QR created atomically
  → Seller prints and attaches it
  → Logistics views/resolves it in Pickups
  → assigned Courier scans it at physical handoff
  → Courier submission is validated and recorded by Logistics
  ```
- Creating, viewing, downloading, printing, or scanning a waybill does not itself change Order or custody status.
- A Courier QR/reference scan is an ingress/access event, not a custody transition. Only the shared transition service may advance physical state after Admin dispatch operations validate the submitted event/evidence.
- Current explicit Courier pickup confirmation commits first-mile custody and Inventory after QR/manual verification. Logistics hub receiving scans the 1D Code 128 barcode first, accepts the waybill QR if the bars cannot be read, or accepts a manual reference into a device-local outbox. The dedicated bulk endpoint commits `received_at_hub` without replaying Inventory effects.
- The immutable waybill `reference` is the explicit human `tracking_id` for the MVP. Every A6 portrait PDF contains a 1D Code 128 barcode that encodes that tracking ID, with a white side margin and taller bars for camera capture, plus the existing QR as a compatibility/fallback identifier; a bulk download may combine up to 30 one-page A6 labels for one pickup request or schedule.
- **Non-goals:** thermal-printer drivers, external carrier labels, parcel weight/dimensions, multiple parcels per Order, route mutation, status mutation by document generation, or public unauthenticated tracking.

## MUST

### Creation and identity

- Require active approved Seller access and resolve every Order through the authenticated Seller's Shop.
- Waybill creation is a server-owned side effect of the locked pickup-request transaction, not a separate client-supplied document action.
- Create exactly one logical waybill per Order after validating `seller_processing`, payment/address snapshots, Inventory reservation, selected dispatch operation eligibility, and pickup-request idempotency.
- In the same transaction, persist the pickup request, immutable provider, Order links, `ready_for_pickup` events, and waybill snapshots; any failure rolls back all of them.
- Generate a non-sequential human-readable tracking ID with database uniqueness; expose the existing waybill reference as a backwards-compatible alias, never as a raw database primary key.
- QR payload contains only a version marker and random opaque lookup token/reference; it contains no names, addresses, phone numbers, item data, payment facts, or authorization claims.
- Store only a keyed hash of any bearer-like verification token; scanning always rechecks the authenticated actor and current Order/task relationship.
- A retry with the same idempotency key returns the existing waybills; concurrent requests cannot create two current waybills for one Order.
- The waybill reference, Order, Shop, selected LuboSmart dispatch operation, destination snapshot, and QR identity are immutable from creation.
- During the Seller pickup transaction, read the Buyer postal-code snapshot and the selected dispatch operation hub's current active sort plan. Store the resulting plan/postal-code/lane match as an immutable routing hint; the hub's scan-time plan remains authoritative if the plan changes later.
- Corrections after pickup request require a future void-and-reissue policy; MVP does not edit or regenerate authoritative snapshot data.

### Content and privacy

- Render from a server-owned `WaybillSnapshot`, never from arbitrary HTML, filenames, URLs, or printable fields submitted by a browser.
- Show tracking ID (with waybill-reference alias) and Order reference, created timestamp, Shop name, safe Seller pickup details, recipient/delivery address snapshot, selected dispatch operation business/hub, COD marker/collectible amount, item quantity count, QR code, and thin Code 128 barcode.
- Do not print product names or SKUs in MVP; the parcel exterior should not reveal purchase contents.
- Print only the contact numbers operationally required for pickup/delivery; mask them in ordinary JSON DTOs and authorize full display only in the PDF.
- Never include credentials, payment-card data, private registration documents, internal notes, raw storage paths, database IDs, or QR secrets in logs.
- Use a fixed local template and bundled/local fonts/assets; disable remote Dompdf resources and reject user-authored HTML/CSS.
- Return `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, `Content-Type: application/pdf`, and a sanitized deterministic filename.

### Seller packing and printing experience

- Before **Request pickup**, show concise steps: pack and seal each Order separately; confirm the items; request pickup; print its waybill; attach it flat outside the parcel; keep the QR/reference uncovered and readable.
- Warn Sellers not to place the waybill across a seam, fold, tape glare, or cover the QR; reprint if damaged or unreadable.
- After commit, show per-Order Preview/Download/Print and a **Print all** action for up to 30 Orders.
- Preview, download, and reprint never create a new waybill, request, notification, Inventory movement, or status event.
- Record a minimal append-only print/download audit event with actor role/user, waybill, timestamp, action, and request correlation ID; never claim the browser physically printed.
- A PDF-generation failure after the identity exists returns a retryable error and does not void the pickup request; deterministic rendering must succeed later from the snapshot.

### Role and tenant access

- Seller can read only waybills for Orders in its server-derived Shop.
- Logistics can read only waybills whose immutable selected organization equals its authenticated organization.
- Courier can resolve/scan only a waybill connected to its active approved affiliation and assigned first-mile/final-mile task; Courier receives no web UI in this repository.
- Buyer, unrelated Seller/Logistics/Courier, inactive accounts, and guessed references receive no document or existence disclosure.
- A scan resolves the waybill and returns a minimal authorized parcel/task match; the Courier submits the scan/evidence to the owning LuboSmart dispatch operation through a separate, versioned task-transition API.
- Admin dispatch operations validate the waybill/Order/Parcel link, task leg, current state, Courier authorization, and idempotency before recording the authoritative event. The event preserves the performing Courier, recording authorized Admin dispatch account, timestamp, and safe reference/evidence metadata.
- A scan or waybill-access event alone never advances custody or `OrderStatus`; a validated event must pass the shared transition service.
- Logistics Receiving and Sorting scan the same parcel tracking ID/waybill into separate device-local outboxes. A Sorting lane label is an internal location selector and never creates or replaces the parcel's immutable waybill. Automatic Sorting resolves the tracking ID server-side and rechecks the current postal-code sort plan.
- A copied QR code is not proof of possession, delivery, identity, or permission and cannot bypass task assignment.

### Courier scan and custody boundary

- The external Courier app scans the opaque QR/reference and submits the payload, task leg, expected revision, and permitted evidence metadata; it does not submit a new status or actor identity as authority.
- The backend records the Courier's resolve/access event separately from the physical handoff event. `waybill_access_events` therefore remain audit records, not custody history.
- Logistics is the authoritative recorder for accepted physical scan/evidence. Failed validation records a safe rejection state where allowed and leaves custody unchanged; retrying an identical submission is idempotent.
- Physical pickup and hub milestones use the approved detailed `snake_case` Shipment/DeliveryTask states. No source-only uppercase status is created by scanning.

### PDF and QR dependencies

- Add `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf:^3.1.2` for Laravel 13 integration and explicitly constrain `dompdf/dompdf:^3.1.6` or newer patched 3.x.
- Dompdf is free/open source under LGPL-2.1; the Laravel wrapper is MIT and supports Laravel 13.
- Add `bacon/bacon-qr-code:^3.1` and use its SVG backend; it is BSD-2-Clause, supports PHP `^8.1`, and avoids a new GD/Imagick runtime dependency.
- Add `picqer/php-barcode-generator:^3.2` (resolved to 3.3.0) and render the thin Code 128 tracking-ID barcode as an embedded SVG. Picqer is LGPL-3.0-or-later and runs locally without a paid or hosted barcode service.
- Review all transitive licenses and run `composer audit` at implementation/CI time; lock exact resolved versions in `composer.lock`.
- Keep Dompdf remote access disabled, restrict local paths, bound render time/memory, and never render untrusted HTML or images.
- Sources: [Laravel Dompdf package](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-dompdf), [patched Dompdf release](https://packagist.org/resources/js/dompdf/dompdf), and [BaconQrCode package](https://packagist.org/resources/js/bacon/bacon-qr-code).

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Request pickup creates one immutable waybill per eligible Order and no waybill for a failed transaction.
- [x] Seller and selected dispatch operation can view/download the same authorized PDF; unrelated tenants cannot infer it exists.
- [x] Every PDF remains one A6 page, contains the required snapshot fields, has a readable QR, Code 128 barcode, and human reference, and exposes no product names or secrets.
- [x] The primary 1D barcode encodes only the immutable tracking ID with a thin Code 128 profile; QR remains available for compatibility and fallback.
- [x] Pickup-time routing snapshots record the Buyer postal code and selected dispatch operation sort-plan hint without making the historical hint authoritative over a later scan.
- [x] Repeated generation/download/print returns the same identity and causes no Order, Inventory, task, or notification mutation.
- [x] Courier scans require assignment authorization and cannot directly advance custody state.
- [x] Dependencies are license-reviewed, patched, locked, and usable without paid services or added browser/server binaries.

- Logistics camera scanning keeps the same stream across scan-handler/page-state updates, enables muted inline autoplay, and releases tracks on Stop/unmount even during startup. Unsupported preferred settings retry with basic video constraints; HTTPS, unsupported browser, permission, missing/busy camera, and playback failures show actionable errors while retaining manual entry.
- Camera decoding waits for current video frames and nonzero dimensions. Temporary unavailable frames (including `InvalidStateError`), unreadable barcodes, and interrupted startup playback retry without stopping the stream; fatal decode failures reach the page error notice before cleanup.
- Decode captured RGBA pixels through a rotatable luminance buffer, bypassing the installed browser reader’s broken rotation-canvas initialization. Blank frames remain normal barcode misses; thin horizontal and rotated Code 128 labels retain dense scanning. Fatal camera/decode exceptions are available in the local browser console without logging decoded payloads.
- Physical camera testing found that a photographed full A6 page with too few pixels across the narrow bars can fail Code 128 decoding despite matching encoder/decoder formats. Keep the whole barcode and white margins sharp and close enough to occupy most of the camera preview. The shared Logistics scanner tries Code 128 first, then accepts only an `LUBOSMART:WB:1` waybill QR on a bounded fallback cadence; it rejects unrelated QR values. The QR resolves to the same tracking ID and retains normal server-side authorization and state checks. A rasterized complete A6 PDF decodes as Code 128 at 144 and 192 DPI; on-site camera/print verification remains required.

## HOW

### Data model and services

- Add new migrations only for UUID `waybills`, immutable `waybill_snapshots`, and append-only `waybill_access_events`; sort-plan tables and scan metadata belong to the Logistics Sorting contract and are additive there. Do not edit executed migrations.
- Enforce unique `order_id`, `reference`, and `qr_token_hash`; store enum-like `status`/`action` fields as strings with PHP enum casts.
- Link the waybill to Order, pickup request, Shop, selected LuboSmart dispatch operation, and sole hub; use restrict-on-delete or retained snapshots for history.
- Implement `CreateWaybill`, `RenderWaybillPdf`, `ResolveWaybillQr`, and role-specific policy/resource classes.
- Generate the QR SVG server-side and embed it as a local/data URI in the fixed Blade PDF view; do not fetch QR images from a third party.
- Prefer render-on-demand from the immutable snapshot; if caching PDFs later, use the configured private filesystem/Azure disk with authorized streaming and checksum/version invalidation.
- Keep template version, snapshot schema version, and content checksum so later template changes do not mutate the historical data contract.
- Use a dedicated queue only if bulk rendering exceeds the normal request budget; single-document downloads should stream synchronously with bounded execution.

### Interfaces and UI

- Seller: `GET /api/v1/seller/orders/{order}/waybill` and `GET /pickup-requests/{pickup}/waybills.pdf`.
- Logistics: `GET /api/v1/logistics/pickups/{pickup}/waybills` and `GET /waybills/{waybill}.pdf`.
- Courier API: `POST /api/v1/courier/waybills/resolve` remains access-only; implemented task-scan endpoints submit QR/reference evidence. Logistics uses `POST /api/v1/logistics/receiving/batches` for idempotent hub receipts and `/api/v1/logistics/sorting/sessions/{session}/batches` for idempotent standard/exception lane captures. These mutations still pass the shared Shipment/DeliveryTask transition rules.
- JSON metadata exposes both `tracking_id` and the backwards-compatible `reference`, created time, printable capability, and authorized links; PDF bytes use dedicated streamed responses.
- Seller UI follows `Documentation/design.md` and shared `@lubosmart/ui`; Logistics shows waybill actions within its role-isolated Pickups screens.
- Preview must use the same backend-rendered PDF as Download/Print so browser HTML cannot diverge from the physical label.
- Bulk output preserves deterministic Seller-selected Order order and reports any ineligible Order before rendering; it never silently omits a page.

### Verification and rollout

- API tests cover role/status/Shop/organization/task isolation, IDOR, idempotent creation, concurrency, rollback, immutable snapshots, and no side effects on view/print/scan/resolve. Add scan-submission tests for Logistics validation, actor preservation, duplicate/revision conflicts, and no custody mutation on access or failed evidence.
- Render tests inspect headers, page size/page count, required text, forbidden data, QR payload, and QR decode against the reference at multiple print/scanner resolutions.
- Security tests reject raw/unhashed tokens, hostile printable input, remote-resource fetches, path traversal, oversized render inputs, and stale/void references.
- Test address Unicode, long but valid snapshot values, page overflow, printer-safe contrast, keyboard access, repeated downloads, and deterministic checksums.
- Run focused tests on MySQL, `composer audit`, Laravel formatting, and Seller/Logistics lint, JavaScript, and production builds.
- Log waybill/reference IDs, actor/tenant, action, template version, render duration, size, and result; exclude snapshot PII and QR payload/token.
- Alert on render failure rate, unexpected multi-page single labels, QR validation failure, and repeated unauthorized resolution attempts.
- Roll out after pickup/provider schema and the shared transition contract, before physical Courier scanning; keep resolve/access fail-closed and separate from custody until the scan/evidence migration and Logistics recorder are deployed.
