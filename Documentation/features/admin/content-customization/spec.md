# Admin Homepage Advertisement Content Customization

## WHAT

- Authorized Admins manage the public advertisement layer at the top of the Buyer homepage.
- Admins can create, edit, order, schedule, activate, archive, and publish advertisements with:
  - a required internal-only advertisement title used as an Admin tag
  - desktop image and optional mobile art-directed image
  - safe destination link
- The layout is selected for the advertisement layer only:
  - `single`: one advertisement in one full-width block.
  - `carousel`: two or more advertisements in one automatically rotating block.
  - `multi_block`: one large advertisement plus two smaller stacked advertisements.
  - `multi_block_carousel`: a carousel in the large block plus two smaller static advertisements.
- Desktop multi-block layouts use one large primary region and two stacked secondary regions. Mobile stacks the primary, secondary-top, and secondary-bottom blocks without horizontal overflow.
- Laravel owns authorization, validation, media persistence, slot integrity, publication, cache invalidation, and audit records. Admin React owns forms, image-filename feedback, ordering, and state feedback. Buyer React renders the published API projection.
- The current `HomepageCampaign` records and `GET /api/v1/buyer/home` campaign data are the existing integration foundation. The feature replaces the hard-coded hero/side composition with a server-selected advertisement-layer contract.
- This feature is separate from Platform Settings announcements, Push Notification Management, product/category/deal sections, Seller content, and third-party ad networks.
- Non-goals: arbitrary HTML/CSS/JavaScript, video or animated advertisements, audience targeting, ad billing, impression guarantees, or a general homepage page builder.

## MUST

### Access, lifecycle, and isolation

- Every Admin mutation/read requires Sanctum authentication, an active persisted `ADMIN` role, and the existing `platform-settings.view` or `platform-settings.manage` permission as appropriate. React visibility is not authorization.
- Use project-standard `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, and upload `429` responses for authentication, permission, scope, concurrency, validation, and throttling failures.
- Keep draft editing separate from the published configuration. Recommended lifecycle: `DRAFT → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED`.
- A publish operation must atomically persist layout, rotation interval, slot assignments, and all referenced advertisement content. It must never expose a half-configured layout.
- Published configuration/content is immutable. Editing published content creates a copied draft or replacement content record; it does not mutate what Buyers currently see.
- Use optimistic `revision` checks and `lockForUpdate()` (or the repository equivalent). Concurrent saves or publishes return `409` and do not overwrite newer work.
- Admin data must be scoped to the advertisement feature. Buyer, Seller, Courier, and other Admin records must not be exposed or mutated through these endpoints.

### Content and layout rules

- Each configuration has a required, trimmed, plain-text `tag_title` used only to identify the advertisement in Admin. It is never exposed to Buyers. Individual advertisement blocks have no authorable title, description, or alt-text fields; artwork is image-led and linked ads retain a generic accessible name.
- Destination links may be Buyer-relative or external `http`/`https` URLs. Reject control characters, protocol-relative URLs, `javascript:`, `data:`, and other non-web schemes; never trust a client-supplied sanitized URL.
- An uploaded desktop image is required. A mobile upload is optional; when absent, the desktop asset is used with a responsive crop. The Admin form does not accept manually entered image URLs, and the API returns delivery URLs, never disk paths.
- `single` publishes exactly one eligible advertisement.
- `carousel` publishes at least two eligible advertisements in explicit order.
- `multi_block` publishes exactly three unique advertisements: `primary`, `secondary_top`, and `secondary_bottom`.
- `multi_block_carousel` publishes at least two unique primary slides plus exactly one advertisement in each secondary slot.
- An advertisement may occupy only one slot in a published configuration. Reordering changes presentation order, not content ownership.
- `rotation_interval_seconds` is server-validated; use six seconds by default with a bounded 3–20 second MVP range. The Buyer client must use the returned value rather than a hard-coded timer.
- Only published, active, non-expired, eligible advertisements are returned to Buyers. Draft, archived, invalid, missing-media, and future/expired content is excluded by Laravel.
- One optional start/end window applies to the complete advertisement configuration, including every block and carousel slide. Before the start or at/after the end, Laravel excludes the whole layer; individual blocks are never independently scheduled. Inactive or missing required slots still receive deterministic defaults where applicable, and the rest of the homepage remains usable.

### Buyer interaction and accessibility

- The Buyer response exposes one `advertisementLayer` projection containing the selected layout, rotation interval, slot/slide order, image delivery URLs, and safe link. It must not expose Admin tag titles, revisions, storage metadata, unpublished content, or internal notes.
- Changing the layout may change only the advertisement-layer projection and its rendering. `viewer`, quick actions, categories, flash deals, product rails, recently viewed items, recommendations, header, and search behavior remain unchanged.
- `carousel` and the primary region of `multi_block_carousel` provide previous/next controls and slide selection indicators. A one-item result has no rotation controls.
- Carousels continuously rotate using the configured interval and a smooth horizontal slide transition. They do not expose a play, pause, or resume control, and focus/hover does not interrupt rotation.
- Use semantic region/group/slide structure, visible or referenced slide names, keyboard-operable native buttons, visible focus, and non-color-only state communication. Do not trap focus or announce automatic changes noisily.
- Linked advertisements must expose a clear generic accessible name and work by keyboard, touch, and pointer. Mobile must preserve reachable links and usable image layouts without horizontal overflow.
- Public homepage reads remain read-only, guest-compatible, Laravel-backed, bounded, and safe for the existing public cache. Buyer-private homepage data must not enter the advertisement cache.

### Media, cache, and accountability

- Follow `Documentation/references/file-upload-requirements.md`: accept only valid JPEG, PNG, or WebP images under 10 MiB; inspect signature/MIME and decode server-side; reject spoofed, malformed, oversized, or double-extension files.
- Store bytes on the configured local public disk or Azure Blob disk using server-generated keys. Advertisement records retain only the generated storage key, configured disk, and safe original filename metadata; do not store Base64, browser blob URLs, or raw storage credentials.
- Draft/private media is inaccessible to Buyers. Public delivery requires an authorized published configuration and approved asset state; private delivery uses an authorized application endpoint or supported short-lived URL.
- Upload, content update, archive, slot/layout change, and publish operations create safe immutable Admin audit events with actor, target IDs, layout/slot metadata, and changed-field summaries. Never copy image bytes, credentials, or private URLs into audit data.
- Invalidate the existing homepage campaign/configuration cache only after a successful transaction commit. Coordinate Laravel cache and the React public revalidation/TTL so a published layout becomes visible without changing unrelated homepage data.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] An authorized Admin can create a tagged draft advertisement, upload a required desktop image and optional mobile image, optionally enter a link, see the persisted image filename instead of an image preview, and save field-addressable validation errors.
- [ ] Admin can choose each of the four layouts, assign valid unique slots/order, set the rotation interval, and receive a publish-blocking error for incomplete layouts.
- [ ] Publish atomically changes the Buyer advertisement layer; drafts and stale/conflicting requests never reach Buyers.
- [ ] An archived advertisement can be permanently removed by an authorized Admin, while a currently published advertisement cannot.
- [ ] Buyer API returns only the current valid published layer and preserves every non-ad homepage field when the layout changes.
- [ ] Single, carousel, multi-block, and multi-block-carousel render correctly at desktop and mobile breakpoints; multi-block mobile has no horizontal overflow.
- [ ] Carousels support keyboard-accessible manual navigation, slide indicators, continuous automatic rotation, and smooth horizontal transitions without a play/pause control.
- [ ] Unauthorized Admins, non-Admins, Sellers, Couriers, and Buyers cannot access Admin advertisement management or private media.
- [ ] Cache invalidation, audit records, safe links, upload limits, visibility filtering, and stale-revision `409` behavior are covered by focused tests.

## HOW

- Add a dedicated Admin advertisement-management surface, optionally as a section under the existing Platform Settings page, with an internal tag-title field, persisted desktop/mobile image filenames, draft list, slot/order controls, layout selector, configuration-level schedule/interval input, publish confirmation, retry, and conflict recovery.
- Reuse `HomepageCampaign` as the legacy/content foundation where safe; add Admin-owned filename metadata through additive migrations. Add a versioned `HomepageAdvertisementConfiguration` (or repository-equivalent) for the internal tag, layout, interval, whole-layout schedule, slot assignments, status, revision, and Admin timestamps.
- Keep enum-like database columns as strings with PHP enum casts. Do not edit the executed `homepage_campaigns` migration. Map existing `hero` records to primary slides and the first two `hero_side` records to secondary slots during rollout, with a deterministic fallback until a new configuration is published.
- Add Admin Form Requests, Resources, Policies/middleware, services, routes, and a feature-specific upload service. Suggested routes are:
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/homepage-advertisements`
  - `POST/PATCH /api/v1/admin/homepage-advertisements...`
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/homepage-advertisements/uploads`
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/homepage-advertisements/configuration/publish`
  - `GET /api/v1/homepage-advertisement-images/{campaign}/{variant}` for published Buyer delivery through the configured storage disk
- Extend `GET /api/v1/buyer/home` with the `advertisementLayer` DTO while keeping other response keys and owning services intact. The webapp replaces only `HeroCampaignWindow` with a layout-dispatching advertisement component; its existing `HomeDataProvider`, analytics, SSR/CSR boundary, and API client remain the integration points.
- Use React responsive image/art-direction support with accurate `sizes`, prioritized loading for only the initial primary asset, lazy loading for later/lower-priority assets, and server delivery URLs. See the React Image guidance below.
- Backend tests cover permissions, storage-backed upload validation, slot cardinality, safe destinations, draft/publish transitions, whole-layout eligibility, archived deletion, cache invalidation, audit payloads, and unchanged non-ad homepage fields. Frontend tests cover all layouts, mobile order/overflow, filename feedback, loading/error/conflict states, links, keyboard controls, and carousel timing.
- Observe publish failures, incomplete-layer fallbacks, upload rejection categories, and advertisement impressions/clicks using safe ad/configuration IDs and slot/layout metadata; do not record Buyer PII.
- The Buyer homepage must continue using one authoritative API projection for this layer so Admin preview, public SSR, client refresh, and cache invalidation cannot drift into separate advertisement rules.

### Resolved decisions

- Advertisement access uses the existing `platform-settings.view/manage` permissions.
- Admins may publish a complete draft immediately; one optional schedule applies to the full advertisement layout.
- External `http`/`https` destinations are allowed.
- Use responsive `object-cover` art direction within a banner height of roughly 30–40% of the viewport, capped near 280px on phones and 420px on desktop, so the advertisement and following homepage section are visible together on initial load.
- Published layouts use the versioned draft/publish lifecycle, with an explicit Publish now action.
- External `http`/`https` links are allowed and open in the same tab.
- Image filenames replace Admin image previews after upload; all uploaded bytes remain on the configured local/Azure storage disk and are retrieved from that disk for Buyer delivery.
- Title, description, and alt text are not authorable. The required internal tag title is never published; destination URL remains optional because an advertisement may be non-clickable.
- Carousels continuously rotate with smooth side-scrolling and have no play/pause control.
