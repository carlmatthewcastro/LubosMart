# Admin Manage Platform Settings

## WHAT

- Authorized Admins manage platform announcements and the allow-listed policies: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Internal Platform Rules.
- The Admin React dashboard owns the editor, preview, confirmation, history, and error states. Laravel owns authorization, validation, versioning, persistence, cache invalidation, and audit records.
- Policy content is versioned. A published version is immutable; Admins may still choose Edit, which creates a copied successor Draft rather than changing the published record.
- Ordinary user policy views show only the current published version. A separate history view lets an authorized user read prior published/superseded versions.
- **Current state:** Admin announcement/policy CRUD, successor drafts, publication/history, public Terms/Privacy reads, cache invalidation, audit records, and declared platform feature controls are implemented. The shared Policy Viewing and Consent feature owns private status/acceptance endpoints and role-owned consent screens; this feature owns policy records, publication metadata, and the Admin control that governs protected-action enforcement.
- Announcements are separate from Push Notification Management. Publishing an announcement does not imply push, SMS, or email delivery.
- Homepage advertisements appear as a Platform Settings tab but are owned by `Documentation/features/admin/content-customization/spec.md`; this contract does not duplicate their layout/media rules.
- This feature does not manage secrets, `.env`, infrastructure, arbitrary key/value settings, undeclared controls, policy-writing/legal advice, or targeted campaigns.

## MUST

### Access and boundaries

- Every Admin endpoint requires `auth:sanctum`, persisted `ADMIN` role, and `platform-settings.manage` permission where custom permissions apply.
- Laravel is authoritative; hiding an Admin control in React is never authorization.
- Return `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, or `422` consistently for authentication, permission, missing resource, stale state, and validation failures.
- Platform Settings may modify only supported domain records; no API may expose arbitrary runtime configuration or secrets.

### Feature controls

- Feature controls are explicitly declared, platform-wide boolean switches stored in `platform_feature_controls`. Admins cannot create arbitrary keys or write runtime configuration through this API.
- `policy_consent_enforcement` is enabled by default and controls whether the shared Terms/Privacy gate blocks protected dashboard and API actions. Disabling it does not delete or alter existing `policy_acceptances`; re-enabling it applies the current consent rules again.
- Listing controls requires `platform-settings.view`. Updating a declared control requires `platform-settings.manage`, the submitted revision, and an atomic update. Every change records the previous and next value in the Admin audit outbox.
- New controls must define a stable key, user-facing label, description, default, and owning enforcement contract before being seeded. A control must never be treated as authorization by the client alone.

### Announcements

- Support `DRAFT → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED`; only a Draft can be updated or published, and only a Published announcement can be archived.
- Store UUID, title, body, status, revision, creator/updater, timestamps, optional publication and expiry times.
- Validate and safely render content. Use plain text/Markdown unless an approved server-side rich-content sanitizer exists.
- User-facing reads return only currently active Published announcements; drafts, archives, and expired records are excluded by Laravel.
- Publish/archive must invalidate the active-announcement cache after the transaction commits and emit an audit record.

### Policy identities and versions

- Policy types are server allow-listed: `terms_of_service`, `privacy_policy`, and `internal_rules`.
- Maintain one stable policy identity per type and ordered version records with UUID, integer version, title, content, status, revision, creator, publisher, timestamps, and `requires_reconsent`.
- A policy version lifecycle is `DRAFT → PUBLISHED → SUPERSEDED`. Exactly one current Published version may exist for a policy type.
- Published and Superseded content is immutable. It must never be overwritten, deleted, or relabeled as a correction.
- A new Draft receives the next version number. Optional `source_policy_version_id` records which published version it copied; optional user-safe `change_summary` may be shown in history.

### Editing a published policy

- The Admin UI may show **Edit** on the current Published version.
- Edit calls a successor-Draft action; it must lock the policy and selected published version, copy title/content/re-consent settings, assign the next version number, and record the source/version creator.
- The source Published version, its exact content, acceptance records, publication metadata, and audit history remain unchanged.
- The response returns the new Draft ID; all ordinary editing uses that Draft ID. Saving the Draft does not change user-facing policy content.
- If a successor Draft already exists for the same policy/source lineage, return that Draft or `409`; do not create competing successor copies.
- Only Draft versions accept `PATCH`; updates require the submitted revision and increment it atomically.
- Audit successor creation, Draft update, and publication as distinct actions.

### Publishing and concurrency

- Publishing requires an explicit confirmation and submitted Draft revision.
- In one database transaction, lock the Draft and policy, reject stale/non-Draft state, publish the Draft, supersede the former current version, set `current_version_id`, and persist publisher/time/re-consent choice.
- Concurrent create-successor, update, or publish attempts must not create two current versions or overwrite newer content; return `409` and refetch current state.
- Invalidate the current-policy cache only after a successful commit. Any notification/broadcast is queued after commit and cannot roll back publication.

### User policy views and consent

- The default policy endpoint/page returns only the current Published version; it must not render all versions inline.
- A separate history endpoint/page lists and renders exact Published/Superseded versions only, with version, title, publication/effective date, current/superseded state, and optional safe change summary.
- History never exposes Drafts, Admin-only metadata, internal notes, or audit data. Internal Rules remain limited to their authorized audience.
- Terms and Privacy may be public if the product visibility decision permits; otherwise use the project’s authenticated policy route.
- `requires_reconsent` belongs to a specific Published version. It indicates that an already-accepted user may need to accept that successor; it does not by itself decide whether initial acceptance is mandatory.
- The shared policy matrix currently requires initial Terms/Privacy acceptance for Buyer, Seller, Admin, Logistics, and Courier accounts when `policy_consent_enforcement` is enabled; Internal Rules remain outside the shared consent flow. Publication and the enforcement switch never auto-accept users or alter acceptance history.
- The existing `policy_acceptances` schema stores the actor as `user_id`, the exact `platform_policy_version_id` (and therefore its policy identity), and server `accepted_at` with a unique user/version constraint. It is immutable history, not proof that the current version was accepted.
- The shared acceptance API derives the actor from the authenticated session, accepts only an authorized current Published version, rejects Draft/Superseded targets, sets the server timestamp, and makes a same-user/version retry idempotent. It never accepts on behalf of another user or accepts every user automatically.
- Buyer, Seller, Admin, and Logistics consent screens show the complete current policy, an unchecked explicit confirmation, the exact version, a link to published history, validation/session/network retry states, and no success until the server returns the committed acceptance. Courier consumes the same contract from React.
- The shared consent guard compares each required current version with that user's exact acceptance at protected-feature entry. Missing consent returns a stable machine-readable `POLICY_CONSENT_REQUIRED` response and the required policy/version list; it must not be disguised as a generic login failure.
- The protected-action gate remains the shared middleware's responsibility. The `policy_consent_enforcement` control can temporarily disable that gate for all supported roles without changing policy versions or acceptance history. Login/session bootstrap, policy viewing, and acceptance remain reachable in either mode.

### APIs and UI

- Admin Feature controls includes the enabled-by-default `linehaul` switch. Disabling it pauses new route snapshots and departures; receiving committed in-transit manifests remains possible. Updates reuse platform-settings.manage, revisions, and audit events. Logistics configures its own coverage and outgoing connection requests without per-transfer platform approval; the receiving LuboSmart dispatch operation must accept before a directed connection can be used. Admin network configuration cannot bypass that consent, and connection deactivation clears consent/withdraws sender intent.
- Admin APIs follow `/api/v1/admin/platform-settings` conventions:

```http
GET   /announcements
POST  /announcements
PATCH /announcements/{announcement}
POST  /announcements/{announcement}/publish
POST  /announcements/{announcement}/archive
GET   /policies
POST  /policies/{type}/versions
POST  /policy-versions/{version}/successor
PATCH /policy-versions/{version}
POST  /policy-versions/{version}/publish
GET   /feature-controls
PATCH /feature-controls/{key}
```

- User APIs expose current policy content and, when authorized, version history and an exact history entry. They return published-safe DTOs only.
- Current implemented public routes are `GET /api/v1/platform/policies/{type}`, `GET /api/v1/platform/policies/{type}/history`, and `GET /api/v1/platform/policies/{type}/history/{version}`; only Terms and Privacy are public.
- The Admin policy screen shows the current version, a New version action, Edit-to-successor action, Draft editor, Publish confirmation, re-consent checkbox, and version history.
- The Admin sidebar exposes a Feature controls screen. It lists declared switches, shows their current state and revision, requires a confirmation before disabling policy-consent enforcement, handles stale revisions, and explains that changes apply at the API boundary.
- Shared implemented contract: `GET /api/v1/policy-consent/status` returns required current versions and the authenticated user's acceptance state; `POST /api/v1/policy-consent/{type}/versions/{version}/accept` records one explicit acceptance without a client user ID or timestamp. Platform Settings does not duplicate these routes.
- The user experience distinguishes “Edit published policy — creates a new draft” from editing a Draft.
- Forms require labels, keyboard operation, visible focus, associated validation messages, non-color-only status, loading/error/retry states, and no optimistic publish result.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Guests, non-Admins, and Admins without permission cannot mutate Platform Settings.
- [x] Admin can create, edit, publish, archive, and safely render an announcement; only active Published announcements reach users.
- [x] Admin can create a policy Draft and publish it as the sole current version.
- [x] Edit on a Published policy creates a copied successor Draft; the source row remains byte-for-byte unchanged.
- [x] Updating or abandoning a successor Draft does not change the current user-facing policy.
- [x] Publishing a successor supersedes the former current version atomically and preserves exact historical content.
- [x] Stale/concurrent successor, Draft-update, and publish attempts return `409` without corrupting version state.
- [x] User default view returns only the current policy; history excludes Drafts and renders a selected historical version exactly.
- [x] The existing consent schema preserves immutable, exact-version acceptance identity and never auto-accepts users during publication.
- [x] Administrative mutations create safe audit entries and invalidate relevant caches after commit.
- [x] The shared Terms/Privacy matrix requires initial acceptance for all five account roles while Internal Rules remain outside the shared flow.
- [x] A version-specific acceptance API/UI is implemented by the shared Policy Viewing and Consent feature with explicit confirmation, authorization, idempotent retries, and safe error states.
- [x] Protected-action integration enforces missing required consent without blocking login, session restoration, policy viewing, or acceptance. The shared policy middleware returns `403 POLICY_CONSENT_REQUIRED` with required version descriptors.
- [x] Admins with `platform-settings.manage` can enable or disable the declared `policy_consent_enforcement` control with optimistic revision checks; updates are audited and the shared policy middleware honors the persisted value.

## HOW

- Reuse `PlatformPolicy`, `PlatformPolicyVersion`, `PolicyAcceptance`, `Announcement`, their enum casts, UUID migrations, `PlatformSettingsService`, Admin Form Requests/Resources, and the shared Admin API client.
- Reuse `PlatformFeatureControl`, `PlatformFeatureControlSeeder`, `PlatformFeatureControlService`, and the feature-control resource/request. Keep controls declared and seeded; do not add a generic arbitrary-setting editor.
- Add an additive migration for successor lineage/change summary only if those fields are adopted; keep enum-like database columns as strings and Eloquent enum casts.
- Implement successor creation in `PlatformSettingsService` with `DB::transaction()` and `lockForUpdate()` on the policy/version. Add a service/controller route, authorization, request validation, resource projection, and audit action.
- Keep existing Draft-only update and publish paths, but update the Admin page so Published Edit creates/opens a successor Draft. Do not change a Published version through `PATCH`.
- Current public current/history resources and routes already enforce policy-type visibility and exclude Draft/Admin data. Cache only current Published policy payloads. Do not add consent fields to public history DTOs.
- Reuse the shared `PolicyConsentService`, `PolicyConsentController`, and `policy.actor` middleware for status/acceptance. Use the existing `policy_acceptances` table with a transaction and unique user/version guard; do not add duplicate Platform Settings endpoints.
- Reuse the shared consent-status projection in `policy.consent` protected route groups. Keep login/session bootstrap, logout, policy status, and acceptance outside the gate so users can fetch/read the required policy and submit acceptance.
- Test Laravel authorization, allow-listing, immutable source, copied successor data, single-current invariant, stale revision conflicts, history visibility, exact acceptance, cache invalidation, and audit records.
- Test the Admin UI’s successor-edit flow, Draft/publish states, conflict recovery, latest-only user view, history selection, keyboard/error accessibility, and the protected dashboard/API redirect when consent is missing. Shared consent API/role-screen tests cover exact acceptance, gate details, and safe error states.
- The protected-action gate is authoritative at the API boundary. SPA guards mirror it for navigation; the external Courier React client consumes the same `403 POLICY_CONSENT_REQUIRED` contract.
- `PolicyConsentService` reads the persisted `policy_consent_enforcement` value with a safe enabled fallback so deployments without the seeded row fail closed.

### Open questions

- Are Terms and Privacy public, authenticated-only, or role-specific?
- Should a successor Draft be returned or rejected when another Admin already created one?
- **Resolved:** A published `requires_reconsent` version blocks protected-action entry after authentication; registration, login/session restoration, logout, status, and acceptance remain available.
- **Resolved:** All role protected API groups apply the shared `policy.consent` middleware after role/status/affiliation checks. Each dashboard route guard checks status and routes missing consent to its role-owned screen.
- **Resolved:** The global policy-consent gate is an Admin-managed declared feature control, enabled by default; disabling it is audited and does not erase acceptance history.
- What user-facing change-summary format and policy notification channel are desired?
